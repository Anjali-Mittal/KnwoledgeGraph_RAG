"event/Successful_third_Hot_Test_of_Semi-Cryogenic_Engine_Power_Head_Test_Article","has_description","May 31, 2025 ISRO commenced a series of performance evaluation tests in March 2025 of the Semicryogenic engine Power Head Test Article (PHTA) that comprises all the engine systems except the thrust chamber. These tests were planned to validate the design of the propellant feed system, including the low-pressure and high-pressure turbo-pumps, the pre-burner, start system and control components. On May 28, 2025, the Power Head Test Article (PHTA) underwent a third hot test at the ISRO Propulsion Complex (IPRC), Mahendragiri, that was aimed at validating the engine’s ignition and start-up sequence and to derive optimum sequence for the integrated engine. During the test, the engine was successfully ignited and operated up to 60% of its rated power level, demonstrating stable and controlled performance throughout the firing. The PHTA has earlier undergone two hot tests. The first test on 28.03.2025, demonstrated the smooth ignition & bootstrap operation over a short duration of 2.5 seconds. The second hot test on 24.04.2025, demonstrated the start transient build up and tested the start-up sequence by carrying out a hot-firing for a duration of 3.5 seconds. The third test, conducted today, was carried out for a duration of 3 seconds to further fine-tune & finalize the start-up sequence. The Semi-Cryogenic Propulsion Stage (SC120), powered by the 2000 kN-class SE2000 engine, is being developed to replace the current liquid core stage (L110) of the LVM3 launch vehicle towards enhancing its payload capability."

"event/Indian_Space_Situational_Assessment_Report_(ISSAR)_for_2024_Released","has_description","May 29, 2025 Dr. V. Narayanan, Chairman, ISRO/ Secretary, DOS, released the Indian Space Situational Assessment Report (ISSAR) for 2024 compiled by ISRO System for Safe and Sustainable Space Operations Management (IS4OM) on 22nd April 2025.  An executive summary of the ISSAR is presented below. Introduction Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) performs Space Situational Awareness (SSA) activities to protect national space assets against various space environmental hazards, such as Resident Space Objects including space debris, natural objects like asteroids and meteoroids, energy and particle flux. ISRO System for Safe and Sustainable Operations Management (IS4OM) functions as the nodal entity to concert all space sustainability efforts, including SSA activities, and to improve compliance with internationally recognised guidelines on the long-term sustainability of outer space activities. The prime activities conducted are regular assessment of close approach risks posed by resident space objects to satellites and launch vehicles, predicting uncontrolled atmospheric re-entries, and studying the evolution of space object populations. As an integral part of SSA activities, an annual assessment of the prevailing space situation is compiled in the form of the Indian Space Situational Assessment Report (ISSAR) for dissemination to the relevant stakeholders. The highlights of the most recent space situational assessment are presented next. Global Scenario Figure 1: Historical growth of space objects (data sourced from Space-Track) Indian Scenario Statistics of On-Orbit Indian Objects Atmospheric re-entry Close approach risk mitigation for Indian space assets in 2024 Space Object Proximity Analysis (SOPA) for Satellites ISRO regularly carries out analyses to predict close approaches by other space objects to Indian space assets.  In case of any critical close approach, collision avoidance manoeuvres (CAM) are carried out for the operational spacecraft to mitigate the collision risk. The highlights for the year 2024 are as follows: The graph below shows the total number of Collison Avoidance Manoeuvres (CAMs) carried out by ISRO for its Earth orbiting satellites over the last few years.  The number of CAMs was less in 2024 compared to the previous year. This is because improved close approach analysis methodology with larger conjunction screening volume and usage of more accurate ephemerides helped to meet collision avoidance requirements by adjusting orbit maintenance manoeuvres on several occasions and avoiding exclusive CAMs. Figure 2: Cumulative number of CAMs performed for Earth-orbiting satellites of ISRO till 2024 Collision Avoidance Analysis (COLA) for Launch Vehicles COLA analyses for lift-off clearance of launch vehicles were carried out as part of the mandatory Launch Clearance Protocol of ISRO launch vehicles.  The table below shows the COLA results for the launches in 2024. The lift-off of PSLV-C60/SPADEX was delayed based on the COLA analysis.  The figure below shows the so-called “black-out” zones within the launch window, over which the lift-off timings were prohibited for the PSLV-C60 launch to avoid potentially close approach risk with other space objects. Figure 3: Liftoff time slots – COLA results Nominal lift-off timings of all other launches (PSLV-C58, GSLV-F14, SSLV-D3, and PSLV-C59) were cleared by COLA.  To resolve close approach situations with active satellites, the required spaceflight safety related coordination was carried out with the respective operators. Spacecraft Decommissioning and Post Mission Disposal At its end-of life, Scatsat-1 was de-orbited as part of post mission operations through 12 manoeuvres, completely depleting the left-over fuel. Electrical passivation was carried out before its decommissioning on 26 Sep 2024, exactly 8 years after its launch. Two more LEO satellites, INS-2B and EOS-7 were also decommissioned before they re-entered the atmosphere. Post payload injection, the upper stages of PSLV-C58 and PSLV-C60 were de-orbited to 350 km, the former re-entered the atmosphere within 3 months, while the re-entry of PS4 of PSLV-C60 took place on 4 April 2025. PSLV Orbital Experimental Module (POEM) Two PSLV Orbital Experimental Module (POEM) missions were flown for a wide array of technology demonstration on the PS4 of PSLV-C58 (POEM-3) and PSLV-C60 (POEM-4), hosting 9 and 24 payloads, respectively. In both the cases, the upper stages were de-orbited to circular orbits of nearly 350 km altitude and passivated before functioning as POEM, the de-orbiting limited their post-mission life to approximately 3 months.  Usually a technology demonstration mission typically lasts for a short duration of a few months and proper PMD for such smaller, experimental missions are often not feasible due to on-orbit failure and hardware limitations. Therefore, POEM provides an innovative approach allowing an emergent space actor to test and qualify new technologies without requiring to fly individual satellites in space. International Cooperation International cooperation plays a crucial role in obtaining relevant data and information for safe and sustainable operations in outer space. Mitigating space environmental concerns like space debris requires collective efforts.  ISRO participates actively in various international fora deliberating on space debris issues and the long-term sustainability of outer space activities,  these include Inter-Agency Debris Coordination Committee (IADC), International Academy of Astronautics (IAA) space debris working group, International Astronautical Federation (IAF) space traffic management working group, International Organization for Standardization (ISO) space debris working group and UN-COPUOS Scientific & Technical Sub-Committee/ Legal Sub-Committee.  India currently chairs the UN working group on the Long-term Sustainability of outer space activities. ISRO chaired the IADC for the period of 2023-24 and hosted the 42nd annual IADC meet in April, 2024 at Bengaluru, which was attended by nearly 75 foreign delegates from the leading space agencies.  ISRO substantively contributed to the revision of IADC space debris mitigation guidelines, released in January 2025, and the ongoing task of exploring space debris mitigation options for lunar orbits. ISRO also participated in the annual re-entry prediction campaign conducted by IADC (Cluster II/SALSA, ERS-02) by submitting predictions. Debris Free Space Mission One of the major highlights of 2024 in the area of space sustainability was the declaration of India’s intent for Debris Free Space Mission (DFSM) in the plenary session of the 42nd IADC annual meet.  DFSM aims for debris-free space missions by all Indian space actors, both governmental and non-governmental, by 2030, by adopting   the necessary measures during design, operation, and disposal phase. One of the major requirements of DFSM is compliance with PMD of spent orbital stages and satellites with a success probability of more than 99%. Special emphasis is placed on PMD of Low Earth Orbit missions, being the most crowded orbital zone, with a target of limiting the post-mission residual lifetime to 5 years through either controlled re-entry or de-orbiting to a lower orbit.  Mission extensions should be recommended based on assessments of sub-system health, including redundancy aspects so that the ability of PMD (post mission disposal) is not compromised. Another important consideration is to treat 400 km+/-30 km as an orbital band as exclusive for human space missions. Summary and Way Forward The consolidated data for 2024 indicates intensified space activities, as reflected by the maximum number of launches as well as maximum number of re-entering objects. The growing trend in the space object population continued. The sheer number of close approach alerts indicate the alarmingly rising congestion in space, especially low-Earth orbit. With the easier access to space through rideshare coupled with technological advancements, miniaturization, mass-production capabilities, multifaceted application of space-based technology, the future space traffic is not likely to show any signs of slowing down. Based on the projected deployment of multiple large constellations, active satellites are likely to be outnumber space debris population within the current decade, making Space Traffic Management (STM) an indispensable part of spaceflight safety. As of now, there is no accepted framework for STM, hence on-orbit close approach between two active space assets needs to be resolved on case-by-case basis through inter-operator coordination, with non-trivial operational overheads. Consequently, spaceflight safety in future scenario is expected to involve more intensive coordination and cooperation between various spacefaring entities, it is desirable that a suitable collaborative framework evolves for meeting STM requirements. Recognising that Space Situational Awareness (SSA) plays a pivotal role in ensuring safe and sustainable operation, NEtwork for space objects TRacking and Analysis (NETRA) project has been undertaken by ISRO. Establishment of a radar at Chandrapur, Assam, and an optical telescope at Hanle, Ladakh, are in progress under the scope of this project. After refurbishment, the Multi-Object Tracking Radar (MOTR) at Sriharikota also commenced tracking space objects, including the Indian rocket bodies and satellites during their last few orbits before atmospheric re-entry, wherever feasibility existed. The declaration of the Intent of Debris Free Space Mission in 2024 is a testimony of ISRO’s long-standing commitment to preserving the long-term sustainability of outer space activities. In the coming years, ISRO will steadfastly pursue space object observational capacity building for SSA, share experiences, engage with the emergent space actors, and raise awareness on responsible, safe, and secure space activities through proactive implementation of the pertinent guidelines and best practices.

We see the initial eruption and a plasma blob getting ejected from the flaring region and accelerated across the field of view of SUIT. We also see the accelerated part of the ejected loops in the subsequent frames. In this video, the solar disk intensity is suppressed by about a factor of 10 to make it the same intensity as the off-limb structures. The time shown in the movie is given in Universal Time (UT). On 31 Dec 2023, the Aditya-L1 mission witnessed the Sun unleashing an enormous solar flare (an X-class solar flare) that hurled a glowing plasma 'blob' off the sun. Cameras aboard the SUIT payload of Aditya-L1 watched the rare ejection of plasma blob move from a leisurely 300 kilometer per second speed to a blistering speed of 1500 kilometer per second- with this speed one can circle the entire earth in half a minute. This is first time; such an eruption is caught in near-ultraviolet light which offers scientist a new class of data sets to understand solar phenomena more deeply. Solar Flares are highly energetic explosions in the solar atmosphere. These are characterized as sudden, intense bursts of energy caused by the release of magnetic energy. During solar flares, a huge amount of radiation is emitted and energetic particles are ejected. These both impact the space weather and geo-space environment, including effects such as disruption in radio communication, power grid disturbances, satellite damage, risk to astronauts and flights etc. Considering the importance of solar flares for technology that is of day to day use, it is of paramount importance to develop a comprehensive understanding of their origin, evolution and properties, with the final aim of being able to predict them substantially in advance so that provisions may be made to shield communication satellites, power grids etc. Solar flares radiate across the complete electromagnetic spectrum. However, due to sparsity of observations in other wavelengths, they are primarily studied in the X-rays and extreme-ultraviolet, which are towards the higher energy of the electromagnetic spectrum, and to some extent in radio. However, very little is known about their properties in the Near Ultra-violet (NUV) and visible. To develop a comprehensive understanding of flares, it is necessary to, as a first step, develop the complete spectral energy distribution in flares, which can then be complemented with theoretical models, thereby helping us to derive mechanisms of flare and associated radiation. One of the science goals of the Solar Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (SUIT) on board Aditya-L1 is to study solar flares in NUV wavelength range of 200-400 nanometers, using 11 different filters. The filters are carefully chosen in such a way that it covers the lower (photosphere) and middle (chromosphere) atmosphere of the Sun. Such observations have never been made before. Therefore, these observations, for the first time, provide the inputs regarding flare radiation which has been missing to date. The Aditya-L1 spacecraft was precisely launched into its intended orbit by PSLV C 57 launch vehicle of ISRO on September 2, 2023. After a series of complex Earth-bound maneuvers, the spacecraft was successfully placed in a large halo orbit around first Sun-Earth Lagrange Point (L1) on January 6, 2024. The first images from SUIT instrument were taken on December 6, 2023. Since then SUIT has gone through and successfully completed the verification and calibration process. From October 2024, SUIT is making regular science observations. The observation presented here from 31st December, 2023 is from the initial cruise phase before L1 insertion of Aditya-L1 spacecraft. On the eve of the new year 2024 an X-class flare erupted at the east limb of the sun from the active region NOAA 13536 and peaked at ~ 21:55 UT. The flare was also associated with a Coronal Mass Ejection (CME) which exhibited a very high velocity ~ 2852 km/s. The flare consisted of two eruptions. During the cruise phase, the onboard flare detection module was not turned on, and the flare was observed only in the Mg II h (280.3 nm, NB04) channel. SUIT observed a plasma blob getting ejected from the flaring region, which subsequently gets accelerated across the SUIT field of view. Figure 1.(a) Full disk binned image recorded by SUIT in the Mg II h filter. The over-plotted white dashed box locates the flaring region. (b) GOES SXR 1–8 angstrom observation of the flare. The flare consists of two soft X-ray peaks, which are marked by two black arrows and their corresponding timing. (c) – (h) Time evolution of flare in Mg II h and associated ejected plasma blob located with white arrows. The field of view corresponds to the boxed region shown in panel a. The velocity of the plasma blob matches closely with the measurements from Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) onboard Solar Dynamic Observatory (SDO), a NASA mission which has been observing the Sun since 2010. With the larger field of view of SUIT, the plasma blob could be tracked further out into the Solar Atmosphere. The hard X-ray observations from the Spectrometer Telescope for Imaging X-rays (STIX) payload onboard ESA Solar Orbiter (Solo) mission, showed dynamically varying signal during the acceleration phase of the plasma blob.  It was also found with the radio observations from Radio Solar Telescope Network (RSTN) and Stereo-A waves, there were multiple type III bursts during the acceleration of the plasma blob. The type III bursts are indicative of acceleration of electrons along the open free magnetic field line. The simultaneous observation of acceleration of the plasma blob, the dynamically varying hard X-ray and the type III bursts signify magnetic reconnection. The SUIT observed blob is cold prominence material suspended in the erupting loop structure, which gets accelerated during the ejection. This observation demonstrates the capability of SUIT in connecting eruptive events like prominences and CMEs back to the solar surface. Figure 2. STIX hard X-ray 25–50 keV(blue dot-dashed line), and time derivative of GOES 1–8 angstrom (transparent red solid line) over-plotted on RSTN radio spectrogram (panel a) and STEREO-A/WAVES radio spectrogram (panel b). The inset panels A, B, C and D show combined AIA 171 and 1600 A observations during this time. The brown solid vertical lines are the times of inset panels A, B, C, and D. The magenta dashed vertical line marks the start of the acceleration of the plasma blob, as observed from SUIT. In this research, SUIT observations are used in tandem with data from other observatories like SDO, SolO, RSTN, Stereo-A and GONG (Global Oscillation Network Group). This marks the significance of simultaneous solar observations with multiple instruments, enhancing the observatory-class spirit of Aditya-L1 and highlighting the importance of collaborative observations with ground and space telescopes from across the world.

"event/Primitive_mantle_material_revealed_by_Chandrayaan-3_APXS_volatile_measurements_in_the_South_Polar_Region_of_the_Moon","has_description","April 30, 2025 Scientists of the Physical Research Laboratory (PRL), Ahmedabad have analysed the concentrations of volatile elements measured at Shiv Shakti statio near the South Polar Region, using the Alpha Particle X-ray Spectrometer (APXS) onboard the Pragyan rover of the Chandrayaan-3 mission. A comparison of the APXS measured abundances with the other available data revealed anomalous depletion in sodium and potassium, but enrichment in sulfur in the soils at the highland landing site. This study published in the journal Nature Communications Earth and Environment has revealed potential presence of primitive lunar mantle materials at the landing site, which was excavated during formation of the South Pole-Aitken (SPA) basin 4.3 Ga ago and redistributed by subsequent impacts on the SPA basin ejecta. The primitive mantle contributed the excess sulfur, which got mixed up with the materials at the landing site. The low levels of sodium and potassium at the landing site suggests that the KREEP (potassium, rare earth elements, and phosphorus) might not have existed at the place and time of SPA basin formation. This new finding makes the Chandrayaan-3 landing site a promising site to access primitive mantle samples, which is otherwise lacking in the existing lunar collections. On 23 August 2023, the Chandrayaan-3 mission marks the first successful landing in the South Polar Region of the Moon. The Alpha Particle X-ray Spectrometer (APXS) aboard Pragyan rover directly measured the elemental composition of the Moon’s surface at unexplored location, i.e., Shiv Shakti statio located at 69.37° S, 32.32° E in the southern high-latitude highlands of the nearside of the Moon. The APXS measurement of major elements supported the lunar magma ocean (LMO) hypothesis. It also provided clues for the presence of lower crust and/or upper mantle materials at the landing site (Vadawale et al., Nature, 2024;https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07870-7). The APXS also measured abundances of volatile elements, including sodium, potassium, and sulfur in the highland soils, and reported varied concentrations ranging from 700-2800 ppm, 300-400 ppm, and 900-1400 ppm, respectively (Fig. 1). Scientists from the Physical Research Laboratory (PRL), Ahmedabad, have made a detailed analysis of the abundances of these volatile elements. Interestingly, the concentrations of sodium and potassium at the Chandrayaan-3 landing site was found to be much lower compared that found in the soil samples from lunar highlands in earlier missions (Apollo 16 and Luna 20), while the concentration of sulfur was found to be 300-500 ppm higher than in soils from Apollo 16 and Luna 20 missions. The anomalous differences in the concentrations of these volatile elements make it important to investigate the probable source that led to their enrichment or depletion at the Chandrayaan-3 landing site. On the Moon, the Type I Carbonaceous chondrite (CC) meteorites crashing on the surface can add approximately 400-1000 ppm of sulfur to the soil (Fig. 2). But, this is still insufficient to explain the APXS measured excess of 200-400 ppm sulfur. Moreover, the surface temperature observed at the landing site ranges between 250 and 300 K, which is much higher than the volatility temperature of sulfur (Fig. 2). In this case, the cold-trapping mechanism of surface enrichment of sulfur for geologically long periods is not possible at the landing site. Therefore, there has to be another source of sulfur that increased its concentration at the landing site. During the end of the lunar magma ocean (LMO) crystallization stages, the residual molten layer became enriched in a mineral called Troilite (FeS). The PRL scientists have proposed that the South Pole-Aitken (SPA) basin impact event at 4.3 Ga excavated this FeS from the sulfur-enriched primitive lunar mantle, while the KREEP layer was still in the process of formation (Fig. 2). The subsequent impacts on the SPA basin ejecta stirred things up, mixing sulfur-rich materials from the SPA basin with the nearby material at the landing site. To summarize, a comparison of volatile elemental abundance data from Chandrayaan-3 soil relative to previous missions, suggests much lower amounts of sodium and potassium, but higher levels of sulfur. Such a pattern indicates that the soil at the landing site include primitive mantle material excavated by the SPA basin impact, billions of years ago. That makes the Chandrayaan-3 landing site a promising place for future missions to collect samples, particularly to study the early evolution of the Moon.

Figure 2:A cartoon depicting the presence of primitive mantle materials at the Shiv Shakti statio as inferred from the Chandrayaan-3 APXS measured volatile abundances. The APXS experiment was designed and developed by Physical Research Laboratory, Ahmedabad, a unit of Department of Space, Government of India. A large group of scientists and engineers from various ISRO centers has contributed in the successful planning, implementation, and execution of the Chandrayaan-3 mission. “Primitive lunar mantle materials at the Chandrayaan-3 landing site”, Sinha et al., Communications Earth and Environment,6, Article #321, 2025"

"event/SPADEX_Mission:_Successful_demonstration_of_Second_Docking_and_Power_Transfer","has_description","April 21, 2025 ISRO successfully demonstrated the docking of the SPADEX satellites (SDX 01 & SDX 02) for the second time on April 20, 2025 at 08:20 PM.Subsequently, power transfer from SDX 02 to SDX 01 satellite as well as vice versa was also exercised and accomplished on 21stApril, 2025. The experiment involved operating a heater element in one of the satellites through power from the other satellite.The duration of power transfer was approximately 4 minutes and the performance of the satellites was as expected. In the second docking attempt, the docking was completed with full autonomy from an inter-satellite distance of 15m till docking, whereas in the first docking attempt, an additional hold point was manually exercised at an inter-satellite distance of 3m. The second docking experiment was preceded by detailed ground simulations and on-orbit trials incorporating the experience gained from first docking & undocking experiments, thereby providing immense confidence for the second docking demonstration. The demonstration of the fully autonomous second docking along with power transfer marks the completion of an important milestone in the SPADEX mission."

"event/Wheat_Crop_Area_and_Production_Estimation_in_India:_A_Pilot_on_Framework_Development","has_description","April 18, 2025 CROP (Comprehensive Remote Sensing Observation on Crop Progress), a                                         semi-automated, scalable framework, developed by NRSC/ISRO enables the near                                         real-time monitoring of crop sowing and harvesting during the Rabi season across                                         India. Using this approach, the progress of Wheat sown areas and the overall                                         crop condition across Indian states were systematically assessed, using Optical                                         and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) remote sensing datasets from EOS-04                                         (RISAT-1A), EOS-06 (Oceansat-3), and Resourcesat-2A, for the Rabi season,                                         2024-25 (Figure 1). Sowing progress of Wheat crop, is being monitored across eight major Wheat growing states of India (Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Punjab, Haryana, Bihar, Gujarat and Maharashtra) during the 2024-25 Rabi season. The spatial distribution of Wheat crop, as of 31st March 2025, across the country is shown in Figure 2a and its state-wise coverage is shown in Figure 2b. Based on this analysis, the Wheat sown area derived from satellite data by 31st March 2025 stands at 330.8 lakh hectares, which is close to the statistics generated by Ministry of Agriculture & Farmers Welfare (324.38 lakh hectares) as on February 4, 2025. Additionally, the crop conditions, drought stress and the overall health of vegetation is monitored using remote sensing based Vegetation Health Index (VHI). The monthly monitoring of vegetation health condition (Figure 3) indicates that in January, crop conditions was generally stable, with timely sowing and satisfactory vegetative growth, especially in wheat growing regions like Punjab, Haryana, and Uttar Pradesh. During February, rising temperatures and rainfall deficits triggered apprehensions about heat-induced stress during grain filling stages, raising concerns over potential yield losses. However, by the end of March, Rabi crops across India showed remarkable resilience, supported by favourable weather in late February and March. By March, crop maturity progressed well under improved weather conditions, leading to optimistic projections. Overall, Rabi crop conditions have remained favourable through late March 2025. Rabi crop harvest commenced in December, showing a progressive increase through January, February, and March and 1st week of April 2025 (Figure 4). Further, experimental assessment of Wheat production, at the national scale, is done by assimilating satellite-derived parameters (crop area, sowing date information, in-season crop condition) in a process-based crop growth simulation model at 5km × 5km spatial resolution. The multi-source data integration is expected to enhance the accuracy of production estimation at a finer spatial level, supporting precise and scalable estimation of Wheat production. The total Wheat production from eight major Wheat growing states of India as on 31st March 2025 is estimated to be 122.724 million tonnes. The spatial distribution of simulated Wheat yield across India for the 2024-25 Rabi season is shown in Figure 5a and Figure 5b. This study demonstrates a methodology for near real-time, in-season monitoring of crop sown and harvested areas using multi-source satellite data. This approach also includes progressive mapping of Wheat crop area and production estimation. This pilot implementation of the framework serves as a Proof-of-Concept, highlighting the potential for operational scalability. The methodology is subject to further refinement and automation to enhance accuracy and timeliness, ultimately aiming to support informed decision-making in agricultural planning and food security at the national level.

Subsequently, POEM-4 was de-orbited by engine restarts to a                                                   nearly circular orbit at 350 km altitude with 55.2oinclination. PS4                                                   was then passivated by venting the leftover fuel to minimise any                                                   potential risk for accidental break-up. During its mission life,                                                   POEM-4 hosted altogether 24 payloads (14 payloads from ISRO and 10                                                   from various NGEs) and all payloads worked as expected yielding                                                   valuable science data. While the POEM-4 was in orbit, it was continuously                                              tracked by ISRO’s Radar Facilities and United States Space Command                                              (USSPACECOM) facilities as well. The tracking data was in turn utilised in                                              the re-entry prediction process. It was observed that POEM-4’s orbit had                                              decayed to 174 km x165 km and the platform was predicted to re-enter the                                              Earth’s atmosphere on April 04, 2025. The atmospheric re-entry event of POEM-4 was then closely                                              monitored by ISRO System for Safe and Sustainable Space Operations                                              Management (IS4OM) and regular updates in predictions were made.

"event/Ocean_Colour_Monotor-3(OCM-3)_Satellite_Imagery_and_Vegetation_Dynamics:_Unveiling_Global_Patterns","has_description","April 03, 2025 Satellites are indispensable in capturing global-scale vegetation patterns, enabling scientists to assess how vegetation growth shifts in response to climate dynamics, environmental changes, and human activities. Instruments such as NASA’s MODIS on Terra and the ISROs EOS-06 OCM-3 payload measure energy across visible and near-infrared regions to derive the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). This index is a crucial tool for understanding how photosynthesis contributes to sequestering carbon dioxide from the atmosphere into biomass and soils, forming a key component of studies on the carbon cycle. Vegetation maps generated from these satellite observations depict a scale of “greenness” that reflects the vegetation density, type, and overall health. Regions with dense, vigorous growth are rendered in dark green, while areas with sparse vegetation appear in lighter, tan hues, with gray representing zones lacking sufficient data. This colour-coded representation illustrates the year-round lushness near the equator—where conditions such as temperature, rainfall, and sunlight are optimal—and highlights seasonal fluctuations in vegetation as one moves toward the poles. The Animation showing the Monthly Global NDVI derived from EOS-06 OCM data during April 2023 – Feb 2025. Advanced processing techniques have further enhanced the value of these remote sensing observations. For example, the EOS-06 OCM-3 system operates in Global Area Coverage mode, gathering data at regular cycles and leveraging GPU parallel processing to manage the immense data volume. By extracting specific spectral bands from Level-1C radiance products, stacking the pixel data, and applying the Maximum Value Composite method, high-resolution NDVI mosaics are generated efficiently. These products have been validated against established MODIS composites, ensuring that temporal variations and spatial patterns in vegetation are reliably captured. Integrating these sophisticated NDVI products into visualization portals supports various applications—from academic research to practical resource management. Farmers and forest managers use detailed vegetation maps to monitor the health of croplands and forests. At the same time, environmental scientists rely on them to analyze broader ecological trends and carbon cycling dynamics. This synergy of advanced satellite technology, high-speed data processing, and detailed mapping deepens our understanding of Earth’s ecosystems. It facilitates more informed decisions in managing natural resources and mitigating climate change impacts."

"event/Leveraging_Indian_National_Satellite_System_(INSAT)_Geostationary_Satellite_for_advanced_lightning_detection_and_analysis","has_description","April 01, 2025 NRSC/ISRO achieves a breakthrough in the now-casting of the lightning events over India using data from Indian geostationary satellites. Atmospheric lightning occurs due to the complex interactions of meteorological parameters under the influence of convective processes in the troposphere. Key drivers of these convective phenomena include surface radiation, temperature, and wind. Lightning now-casting assumes importance as lightning is a dominant natural hazard over the tropics. NRSC/ISRO researchers observed lightning signatures in the Outgoing Longwave Radiation (OLR) data from the INSAT-3D satellite. The reduction in OLR strength is an indicator for potential lightning occurrences. The near real-time observations from the INSAT series satellites were utilized to detect and identify signatures indicative of lightning occurrences. To further enhance the detection of lightning activity, additional parameters such as Land Surface Temperature (LST) and wind were incorporated in the development of a composite variable to improve predictive accuracy. The developed composite variable effectively captures the variations in lightning activity observed by ground-based measurements. It provides a reliable indication of when lightning activity is likely to peak or subside, allowing for improved prediction of lightning occurrence and intensity. This composite variable enables the prediction of lightning occurrences with a lead time of approximately 2.5 hours.

The epicenter is located at 22.013° N 95.922° E at a depth of 10km near Sagaing-Mandalay border. The epicenter of the quake was located near Mandalay, Myanmar's second-largest city, which experienced severe damage. The earthquake also rattled the capitalNaypyidaw and other regions, resulting in the collapse of infrastructure, roads and residential buildings. The tremors were felt not only in Myanmar but also in neighbouring countries. The shockwaves were strong enough to be felt as far as Chiang Mai and northern parts of Thailand, where residents reported damages. Tectonic summary:Myanmar is located near the convergent boundary of the Indian and Eurasian plates, where the Indian Plate is moving northward toward the Eurasian Plate at a rate of about 5 cm per year.In addition to that Myanmar also sits near several smaller fault zones, such as the Sagaing Fault, which runs through central Myanmar. The Sagaing fault is a significant active strike-slip fault that accommodates lateral motion between the blocks of the Indian and Eurasian plates.The present earthquake was likely associated with the release of accumulated stress along the Sagaing fault or its accessory faults in the region. Rapid damage assessment:Post-disaster Cartosat-3 imagery was acquired by ISRO on 29 March 2025, over the cities of Mandalay and Sagaing in Myanmar. Additionally, pre-event Cartosat-3 data acquired on 18 March2025 covering the same area was referred for change analysisand assessment of damage. Significant damage to infrastructure in Mandalay city was observed, with major landmarks such as Sky Villa (Figure 1PDF - 6.4 MB) , Phayani Pagoda, Mahamuni Pagoda and Ananda Pagoda (Figure 2PDF - 6.2 MB) , University of Mandalayand several others suffering either complete or partial damage. In Sagaing city, damage was observed in the Ma Shi Khana Pagoda, along with several monasteries and other buildings (Figure 3PDF - 8.9 MB). As seen from the imagery, the earthquake caused the complete collapse of the historic Ava (InnWa) Bridge (Figure 4PDF - 7.3 MB) on the Irrawaddy River, near Inn Wa City. Cracks/ground ruptures in flood plains of Irrawaddy river with associated liquefaction was also observed. Before and after images of few selected damage sites can beviewed here. The inference on damage was made by a rapid data analysis mode and has to be ground verified."

"event/ISRO_achieves_major_breakthrough_in_Semicryogenic_Engine_development","has_description","March 28, 2025 ISRO is achieving progress in the design &development of a Semicryogenic engine or Liquid Oxygen / Kerosene enginewith a high thrust of 2000 kNthat will power the Semicryogenic booster stage of the LVM3 launch vehicle. The first major breakthrough in the Semicryogenic engine development programme was achieved on March 28, 2025, when the first successful hot test of Engine Power Head Test Article (PHTA),was carried out at ISRO Propulsion Complex, Mahendragiri, Tamil Nadu. The Liquid Propulsion Systems Centre (LPSC) of ISRO is developing the Semi cryogenic propulsion Engine and Stage. The stage (SC120) powered by the 2000kN semi-cryogenic engine (SE2000) will replace the present core liquid stage (L110) of LVM3 for payload enhancement and power the booster stages of future launch vehicles. Non toxic and non hazardous propellants (Liquid Oxygen and Kerosene) are employed in Semi cryogenic propulsion and this will deliver higher performance compared to existing L110 stage. Induction of Semi cryogenic propulsion system along with uprated cryogenic stage in the LVM3 vehicle enhances its payload capability from 4 tonne to 5 tonne in GTO. Major subsystems of SE-2000 engine include thrust chamber, pre-burner, turbo pump system, control components and start up system. The SE2000 engine works with a complex oxidizer rich staged combustion cycle with high chamber pressure of 180 bar (with propellant feed system delivering pressures up to 600 bar) & specific impulse of 335s. The complex engine hardware uses special materials to withstand the high temperature and oxidiser rich combustion. The hardware along with the space grade kerosene are realised in partnership with Indian industry. The development of this engine in these high thrust levels is highly challenging and this technology is available with only very few nations. SE2000 Engine The realization of a test facility to qualify the engine and stage is equally complex and challenging. The complex Semicryogenic Integrated Engine Test facility (SIET) was established at ISRO Propulsion Research Complex (IPRC), Mahendragiri for testing the engine and stage and was dedicated to the nation by the Honourable Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, on February 27, 2024. This facility caters to storage and servicing of large volume of propellants and service fluids at high pressures. The capability of the test stand is validated through several flow and ignition trials. The test stand which involves many sophisticated control components are managed from a Test Control Centre that is also developed indigenously. This facility with a state-of-art PLC-based control system and data acquisition system is capable of testing semi-cryogenic engines up to 2600 kN thrust. Semicryogenic Integrated Engine Test facility, IPRC, Mahendragiri Prior to the conduct of integrated engine level hot tests, it is planned to carry out performance evaluation tests of the intermediate configuration, designated as Power Head Test Article (PHTA),that comprises all the engine systems except the thrust chamber. The hot test that was carried out today, is the first of a series of tests planned to validate the design of the propellant feed system, including the low-pressure and high-pressure turbo-pumps, the pre-burner, start system and control components. All subsystems for the test were realized and had undergone rigorous qualification test prior to integration to Power Head Test Article. Power Head Test Article (PHTA) The Ignition sequence for PHTA was derived from a series of hot tests in single element level. In order to ensure the smooth ignition process during the PHTA test, another test article, Pre-burner Ignition Test Article (PITA), was realized, whichconsists of the pre-burner along with its feed systems, start-systems, and related control components. A series of tests were successfully completed using the PITA and the optimum start sequence for power head test article was derived. Pre-burner Ignition Test Article (PITA) Today’s test demonstrated the smooth ignition and boost strap mode operation of engine over a test duration of 2.5 seconds. The objective of the test was to validate the integrated performance of the critical subsystems such as the pre-burner, turbo pumps, start system and control components by carrying out a hot-firing for a short-duration of 2.5 seconds. The test proceeded as predicted and all the engine parameters were as expected. With this breakthrough, ISRO is further planning a series of tests on the PHTA to further validate and finetune the performance before the realization of the fully integrated engine. PHTA Hot Test"

The induction of these thrusters will result in extensive mass savings thereby enabling the enhancement of transponder capacity in communication satellites. These thrusters use Xenon as the propellant. The Specific Impulse of the Electric Propulsion System, which is a major performance indicator of a space propulsion system, is at least 6 times that of the conventional propulsion system. The life test was carried out under the full power level of 5.4kW in a chamber that simulates the vacuum conditions of spaceand the erosion of the electrode liners was periodically monitored. The erosion data measured during the life test is essential for predicting the subsequent erosion and hence the life of the thruster. This will be an important input for the satellite orbit management.This test is a major milestone to demonstrate the reliability and robustness of the thrusters before induction into the satellites. The Electric propulsion System is proposed to be inducted and validated in the upcoming Technology Demonstration Satellite (TDS-01) of ISRO and will be used for orbit raising to the Geostationary orbit. 300mN SPT developed by ISRO Thruster undergoing life test"

"event/Prediction_of_Equatorial_Plasma_Bubble_Formation","has_description","March 18, 2025 Imagine having a system which can accurately predict with a lead time of one hour, the vagaries of the ionosphere in the lower latitude regions like India, how powerful will be planning in the aviation and satellite navigation sectors. Appreciating the complex nature of the tropical ionosphere, especially near the magnetic equator, this dream has so far been unmaterialized until the National Atmospheric Research Laboratory (NARL) came up with a solution in the form of a prediction algorithm by using long term ionosonde data from three low latitude stations (Trivandrum, Sriharikota and Gadanki) in India. Equatorial plasma bubbles (EPBs) are north-south aligned vertical wedge like depleted electron density structures, which are formed by naturally occurring plasma instability in the equatorial ionosphere. They adversely affect satellite-based communication and navigation systems, high frequency terrestrial communication including the Over-The-Horizon radar applications, and GNSS radio occultation measurements for atmospheric and ionospheric parameters. Many industries/agencies engaged in satellite tracking, aviation, mining, agriculture, and construction are affected by the EPBs. EPBs are formed after the sunset by the Rayleigh-Taylor instability, but their prediction remained a challenge. A new and robust technique has been developed at NARL to predict the formation of EPB. The technique is based on the physics of localized upwelling of the F layer that takes place prior to the sunset (Figure 1). Figure 1:The evening equatorial ionosphere, depicting upward motion of the F layer base due to PRE along with localized upwelling. The localized regions, where the upwelling of the F layer base is higher than their neighbourhood, are the sites for EPB formation. Upwelling has been characterized by the second time derivative of the base height of the F layer (d2h′F/dt2) observed by ionosonde. This, in a way, represents upward acceleration of the F layer ascent (dV/dt) which has a direct bearing on the growth of the instability. It is shown that when the acceleration exceeds a threshold of 0.01 m s-2, EPB is formed. Using large dataset covering diverse solar flux and geomagnetic conditions from three Indian low latitude stations, namely, Trivandrum, Sriharikota and Gadanki, it is demonstrated that prediction for the formation of EPB can be made about an hour in advance with an accuracy of 99.86%, which is unprecedented and remarkable (Figure 2). Figure 2:Quadrature chart showing statistics of prediction and occurrence of overhead EPB. Positive (negative) X-axis represents prediction for the formation of overhead EPB (no overhead EPB) and positive (negative) Y-axis represents observation of overhead EPB (drifted EPB and no EPB). The investigation led to the conclusion that longitudinally distributed ground/space-based sensors monitoring the base of the F layer could provide a viable means for predicting EPB formation in a broader longitude zone for practical purposes. This new prediction technique can greatly improve satellite-based navigation applications. For more details refer to: Patra, A. K., & Das, S. K. (2025). Prediction of equatorial plasma bubble formation using ionosonde observations from India. AGU Advances, 6, e2024AV001323.https://doi.org/10.1029/2024AV001323 This novel algorithm has implications to improve satellite-based navigation applications wherein navigation signals are affected by electron density fluctuations."

"event/ISRO_&_SCL_develops_32-bit_Microprocessors_for_space_applications","has_description","March 15, 2025 On March 5, 2025, the first production lots of the 32-bit microprocessors developed for space applications, VIKRAM3201 & KALPANA3201, were handed over to Dr. V. Narayanan, Secretary, DOS /Chairman, ISRO by Shri S. Krishnan, Secretary, MeitY, in a function organised at New Delhi by the Semiconductor Laboratory (SCL), Chandigarh. These microprocessors were designed & developed by the Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre of ISRO in collaboration with SCL, Chandigarh. Dr. Unnikrishnan Nair, Director, Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre, also participated in the function along with the design teams.                          Dr. Kamaljeet Singh, Director-General of SCL/MeitY and his team provided a brief overview of the activities undertaken for the realization, packaging & qualification of these processors for launch vehicle applications. VIKRAM3201 is the first fully “Make-in-India”    32-bit microprocessor that is qualified for use in the harsh environmental conditions of launch vehicles. The processor was fabricated at the 180nm CMOS semiconductor fab of SCL. This processor is an advanced version of the indigenously designed 16-bit VIKRAM1601 microprocessor which has been flying in the Avionics system of ISRO’s launch vehicles since 2009.  A “Make-in-India” version of the VIKRAM1601 processor was subsequently inducted in 2016 after the 180nm semiconductor fab was established at SCL, Chandigarh. VIKRAM3201 & the VIKRAM1601 has a custom Instruction Set Architecture, with floating-point computation capability and high-level language support for the Ada language. All the software tools such as the Ada compiler, assembler, linker, simulator along with Integrated Development Environment (IDE) are developed in-house by ISRO. A  C language compiler is also under development for providing more flexibility to users in other domains. This is the first of its kind in India and has enabled Atmanirbharata in the area of high reliability microprocessors and onboard computers for navigation, guidance & control of launch vehicles. The initial lot of VIKRAM3201 devices was successfully validated in space in the Mission Management Computer of the PSLV Orbital Experimental Module  (POEM-4) in the PSLV-C60 mission. KALPANA3201 is a 32-bit SPARC V8 RISC microprocessor and is based on the IEEE 1754 Instruction Set Architecture. The microprocessor has been designed to be compatible with open-source software toolsets along with in-house developed simulator & IDE and has been tested with flight software. Four other devices that were jointly developed with SCL were also handed over towards significant miniaturisation of the launch vehicle Avionics system. This includes two versions of a Reconfigurable Data Acquisition System (RDAS) integrating multiple indigenously designed 24-bit Sigma-Delta Analog to Digital Converters on a single chip along with a Relay driver Integrated Circuit & a Multi-Channel Low Drop-out Regulator Integrated Circuit for high reliability applications. Relay Driver IC RDAS (Ceramic package) RDAS (Plastic Package) An MoU was also signed between SCL & Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre of ISRO  for the development & delivery of miniaturized unsteady pressure sensors for measuring dynamic pressure in wind tunnels."

Cryogenic engines for every mission undergo hot testing as part of its acceptance for the flight. Hot tests for the indigenous cryogenic engine (CE20)used in the Cryogenic Upper Stage of LVM3 were so far performed at the High-Altitude Test (HAT) facility at IPRC, where vacuum conditions are simulated with complex installations, limiting the maximum hot test duration to 25s. In the current test, the engine was tested for a longer duration of 100s for the first time using an innovative Nozzle Protection System under non-vacuum conditions. This test method significantly reduces the setup time and effort required for the flight acceptance testing of a cryogenic engine, which in turn helps faster delivery of cryogenic stages for space missions. Performance of the CE20 engine met all the test objectives and the parameters were closely matching with the predictions during the entire duration of the test. Further, this engine will be integrated to the Cryogenic Upper Stage of the launch vehicle for the LVM3-M6 mission, which is scheduled during the second half of 2025."

"event/India_Bags_the_Credit_for_First-Ever_In-Situ_Measurement_of_the_Topmost_Fluffy_Layer_of_the_Moon’s_Surface_at_Southern_Higher_Latitudes:_New_Insight_about_Harbouring_Water-ice_on_the_Moon","has_description","March 14, 2025 India bags the credit for the first-ever in-situ measurement of the temperature of the Moon's surface, down to a depth of ten centimetres, at the Southern higher latitude. So far, the temperature measurements from the subsurface of the Moon by the Apollo 15 and 17 missions focussed to a larger depth of few meters, but direct measurement of temperatures within the topmost fluffy layer is not available. However, in order to assess the propagation of the solar heat flux down to the lower layers of the Moon’s soil, one needs to probe first few centimetres down the Moon's surface (the epi-layer), which is exactly the unique feat achieved by the ChaSTE payload in Chandrayaan 3. That too, strategically measured near a high latitude in the Southern polar region of the Moon for the first time and marks a major progress in lunar science, as well as harnessing of lunar resources at those latitudes in future.  ChaSTE observations from Chandrayaan-3, carried out for a significant fraction of a lunar day, revealed that the Moon’s surface temperatures show a significant spatial variability at metre scales at high latitudes, unlike at the equatorial regions. To elaborate on the scientific importance of this discovery, only Apollo 15 and 17 missions have provided the in-situ data and merely for the equatorial regions of the Moon, while global surface temperatures have been mapped through remote sensing. No in-situ measurement was, so far, available from polar regions of the Moon, until theChandra’sSurfaceThermophysicalExperiment (ChaSTE) experiment onboard Chandrayaan-3’s Vikram lander investigated the temperature profile and thermophysical properties within the top 10 cm of the lunar surface at a high latitude south polar landing location. After the Vikram lander has achieved soft landing at the Shiv Shakti point on the Moon, ChaSTE probe was deployed and successfully penetrated into the lunar soil to carryout measurements for the entire duration of the mission. ChaSTE in-situ measurements were carried out for a significant fraction of a lunar day (~8 AM - 4 PM Local time at the Moon) i.e. approximately 10 Earth days (i.e. from 24 Aug. - 2 Sept. 2023) at an interval of about a second. A team of scientists from Physical Research Laboratory, Ahmedabad; Space Physics Laboratory-Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre (SPL-VSSC), and ISRO, have reported these first-ever in-situ temperatures up to a depth of 10 cm inside the lunar surface near the southern polar region of the Moon at 69.37o S. These temperatures were measured with ten numbers of temperature sensors, mounted along the length of a probe, at different distances. The following figure shows the ChaSTE thermal probe and the locations of the temperature sensors mounted along it. Schematic representation showing the 10 temperature sensors and their mounting locations along the length of the probe The peak surface temperature at Shiv Shakti landing site was measured to be 355 K (± 0.5 K), a temperature relatively higher than ~330 K (±3K), predicted by earlier observations. This unexpected higher temperature is due to penetration of ChaSTE on the Sun-ward (equator-ward) facing surface with a slope of ~6o. Temperatures estimated using 3-D thermophysical model developed by PRL, and appropriately applied for the Chandrayaan-3 landing conditions, is consistent with ChaSTE in-situ measurements. Lunar surface temperature measured from a flat surface using an independent sensor, about a metre away from ChaSTE location, was found to be ~332K (±1K), which is consistent with orbiter based remote sensing observation (~330 K). Therefore, ChaSTE observations indicate that the lunar surface temperatures show a significant spatial variability at metre scales at high latitudes, unlike at the equatorial regions. These effects become prominent as we move towards poles, an important aspect that should be considered for future exploration. Image of the Vikram lander, taken by Pragyan rover, with ChaSTE probe deployed into the lunar surface The Moon's surface thermal environment is among the most extreme of any planetary body in the solar system. Lunar near surface temperature and thermophysics are essential parameters that not only dictate the stability of water-ice/volatiles, but also important for lunar geology and geophysics, resource exploration, mission safety and establishing sustainable long-term habitats on the Moon. Using 3-D Model calculations based on ChaSTE measurements, a relationship between the local slope and expected surface peak temperature was derived to assess the possibility of water-ice stability within the region. An important outcome of these simulations is that the high latitude sites with local slope higher than 14o towards pole might offer similar environment as polar sites for accumulating water ice at shallow depths of few 10s of centimetres. These locations could be promising sites for future lunar exploration and habitation.  Such sites are not only scientifically interesting but also pose less technical challenges for exploration in comparison with regions closer to the poles of the Moon. A comprehensive plot showing in-situ observations and model derived diurnal temperatures at ChaSTE penetration point. Solid blue curve shows ChaSTE observations (for local slope of 6o) and solid red plot represents the model calculated lunar day-night temperatures using ChaSTE observations. Black curve and green dots represent the observed and modelled temperatures respectively, that would have encountered by ChaSTE if it penetrated on a flat location. Model-derived day-night temperatures for various orientations near the landing site are shown in other plots. The green band and blue line represents the optimum temperature conditions for water-ice migration and cold trapping respectively. It can be seen from figure that the temperatures for certain orientations (i.e. poleward slope of >14o) are favourable for water-ice accumulation and storage. ChaSTE experiment is jointly developed by Space Physics Laboratory (SPL) and Physical Research Laboratory (PRL), Ahmedabad with the help of various entities of Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre (VSSC), Thiruvananthapuram and Space Applications Centre, Ahmedabad. This result has both scientific and technological significance. Knowing how heat propagates through the Moon's top layer of soil, just within the first few centimeters, is really important for understanding the depth of influence of surface heat. Because the Moon has no air, this layer gets super-hot and super-cold, which changes how it acts. By understanding how well the surface layer conducts heat and how much heat it can hold, as done by ChaSTE, scientists can figure out how heat moves around, predict temperatures below the surface, and see how sunlight interacts with the Moon. This would also help engineers to find subsurface locations with benign thermal environment and design safe places to plan future trips and live on the Moon. In addition to this, knowing how the soil responds to heat tells us how meteoroids and solar wind changed the Moon's surface over time, giving us a better idea of its unique environment. These measurements will also complement and supplement the remote sensing based global temperature measurements, while the finer in situ probing helps to look for any embedded water-ice within the Moon's subsurface from the local temperature signature. This important result will also help refining our understanding about the energy balance at the Moon, by considering the solar heat forcing, re-radiation of the heat by the Moon's surface, and absorption of the heat. This is another important aspect that help planning scientific measurements for the future lunar missions.

ISRO has now                                         accomplished the pivotal operation of undocking of SPADEX satellites in the very                                         first attempt on 13th March, 2025 at ~09:20 Hrs. The undocking of the satellites                                         took place in 460 km circular orbit with 45-degree inclination. The satellites                                         are now orbiting independently and their health is normal. With this, ISRO has                                         now successfully demonstrated all the capabilities required for rendezvous,                                         docking and undocking operations in a circular orbit. The in-orbit performance of the docked satellites was extensively analysed and                                         an immediate opportunity was found to be feasible from March 10, 2025 till March                                         25, 2025. The entire operations were monitored through ground stations located                                         at Bengaluru, Lucknow and Mauritius. Having accomplished this major mile stone of undocking, further experiments with                                         satellites are planned in the coming days. Exhaustive ground simulations and analysis were the cornerstone of achieving the                                         undocking in the first attempt itself. Various tests replicating on-orbit                                         conditions were meticulously planned and carried out in preparation for the                                         earliest opportunity for undocking operations. ISRO has now successfully demonstrated space docking technology using two small                                         satellites. It is a cost-effective experiment through which, India has achieved                                         space rendezvous, docking and post docking control technologies.

"event/Chandrayaan-2_unveils_the_effect_of_the_Earth’s_geomagnetic_tail_on_the_Lunar_ionosphere_plasma","has_description","March 07, 2025 New study reveals surprisingly high electron densities in the Lunar environment, hinting at the potential role of lunar crustal magnetic fields in shaping plasma dynamics. In a major finding, scientists from Space Physics Laboratory, VSSC, analysing radio signals from India’s Chandrayaan-2 (CH-2) orbiter – which is in good health and providing data -  have revealed that the Moon’s ionosphere exhibits unexpectedly high electron densities when it enters the Earth’s geomagnetic tail. This finding sheds new light on how plasma behaves in the lunar environment and suggests a stronger influence of the Moon’s remnant magnetic fields than previously thought. The scientists have used an innovative method to study the plasma distribution around moon.  In this method they conducted experiments using the S-band Telemetry and Telecommand (TTC) radio signals in a two-way radio occultation experiment, tracking CH-2’s radio transmissions through the Moon’s plasma layer. These signals were received at the Indian Deep Space Network (IDSN), Byallalu, Bangalore. The results revealed a surprisingly high electron density of approximately23,000 electrons per cubic centimetre in the lunar environment,comparable to densities observed in the Moon’s wake region (previously discovered by the same team) and nearly100 times higher than those on the sunlit sideof the Moon. The Moon passes through Earth’s extended magnetic field, or ""geotail,"" for nearly 4 days in each orbit.  During this period, the moon is shielded from direct solar wind, and was thought to have lower plasma densities due to free diffusion along Earth's magnetic field lines.  However, the Chandrayaan-2 observations challenge this assumption.  Scientists have proposed that the presence of remnant lunarcrustal magnetic fieldscould be trapping plasma, preventing its diffusion, and leading to localized enhancements in electron density. To confirm this, they used in-houseThree-Dimensional Lunar Ionospheric Model (3D-LIM)developed at SPL/VSSC, which simulated plasma dynamics under different conditions. The simulations showed that to sustain such high plasma densities, the ionosphere must be inphotochemical equilibrium,a condition only achievable in the geotail when crustal magnetic fields are present. The model also suggested a localized reduction in neutral Argon (Ar) and Neon (Ne) densities near the Moon’s poles, aligning with previous spacecraft observations. High plasma densities can influenceradio communications, surface charging effects,andinteractions with lunar dust,all of which are important for the upcoming robotic and crewed missions near lunar orbital magnetic field region.  Understanding how the lunar ionosphere behaves in different space environments will also improve planning for lunar habitats, particularly in regions influenced by crustal magnetic fields. The study marks a significant step in unravelling the complex plasma environment around the Moon and highlights thecontinued impact of Chandrayaan-2’s science missionin advancing lunar research. As more nations gear up for Moon exploration, findings like these will play a crucial role in shaping the future of lunar science and technology.

"event/Historic_First:_India’s_Solar_Ultra-violet_Imaging_Telescope_(SUIT)_onboard_Aditya-L1_Captures_Unprecedented_Solar_Flare_Details","has_description","February 28, 2025 Aditya-L1, India’s first dedicated space based solar mission, has made a ground-breaking observation from its scientific payloads- capturing the first-ever image ofa solar flare ‘kernel’ in the lower solar atmosphere, namely the photosphere and the chromosphere, in the images recorded in the Near Ultra-violet (NUV) band.This observation and associated scientific results marks a major step in understanding the Sun’s explosive activity and its impact on Earth. Aditya-L1 mission was launched on September 2, 2023 by ISRO PSLV C-57 rocket. On January 6, 2024 the spacecraft was successfully placed in a large halo orbit around first Earth-Sun Lagrange Point known as Lagrange Point L1. The L1 point is 1.5 million kilometres away from Earth towards the Sun. The special vantage point L1 allows the spacecraft to continuously observe various solar activities without any eclipse and occultation’s.  Its advanced instruments, including Solar Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (SUIT), Solar Low Energy X-ray Spectrometer (SoLEXS), and High Energy L1 Orbiting X-ray Spectrometer (HEL1OS), work together to detect and analyse solar flares from Near Ultra-violet (NUV) wavelength to soft and hard X-rays. SUIT payload is developed by Inter University Centre for Astronomy and Astrophysics (IUCAA) in close collaborations with various ISRO Centres. SoLEXS and HEL1OS payloads are developed by U Rao Satellite Centre (URSC), Bengaluru. SUIT can capture high-resolution images in 11 different waveband in NUV of the full solar disk or a specific region on the solar disk of scientific interest depending upon the scientific requirements. As different radiations of different wavelength leave the solar atmosphere from different height/layers, it allows scientists to study multiple layers of the Sun’s atmosphere to study their coupling and dynamics. SoLEXS and HEL1OS instruments monitor solar X-ray emissions, which help detecting the solar flare activity. This collaborative approach and joint data analysis from different instruments of Aditya-L1, gives scientists a complete picture of how solar energy moves through different layers of the Sun. Figure: Aditya-L1 spacecraft in clean room with location of SUIT payload (left). The image of SUIT payload (right). Figure: Illustration of Lagrange points of Sun-Earth system and location of Aditya-L1 (schematic image, not drawn to scale) What is a Solar flare? A solar flare is a sudden and intense burst of solar energy from the Solar atmosphere. The phenomena is caused by Sun’s magnetic field. The magnetic field of the Sun is very dynamic in nature. Sometime they suddenly snap and release intense burst of energy – like a powerful, short flash. The energy is released in the form of light/radiation and high energy charged particles. How Aditya-L1 study the Solar flares? During solar flare (as well as before the occurrence of solar flare) that particular region of the Sun generating flare becomes brighter in  UV and X-ray. Aditya-L1 instruments such as SUIT, SoLEXS and HEL1OS can study these brightening and associated flash of radiation in greater details. This provides a detail picture of various phenomena related to Solar flares. It is to be noted that atmosphere of the Earth blocks these harmful radiations from the Sun to reach to the ground. Therefore, such study can be only made from space. What did researchers observe from SUIT  on-board Aditya-L1? OnFebruary 22, 2024, theSUITpayload onboard Aditya-L1 observed anX6.3-class solar flare, which is one of the most intense categories of solar eruptions. The unique feature of this observation was thatSUIT detected brightening in NUV wavelength range (200-400 nm)—a wavelength range never observed before in such greater detail (See Figure below). These observations confirm that the energy released from the flare spread through different layers of the Sun’s atmosphere. This provides new insights into the complex physics responsible for these massive solar explosions. One of the most exciting revelations in this observation is that thelocalized brightening captured in the lower Solar atmosphere corresponds directly with an increase in the temperature of plasma in the Solar corona at the top of the solar atmosphere. This confirm the linkage between flare energy deposition and associated temperature evolution. This finding also validates long-standing theories while offeringnew data that will help to reshape our understanding of physics of solar flare. Figure: Observation of the flare as obtained from various SUIT filters. Top figure:This figure shows the observations in SUIT narrow band NB04 filter, 280 nanometre (nm) wavelength, which shows the flaring region and the sunspot. The blue box shown in this figure mark the Region of Interest (RoI) of this observation. The region marked with white dashed box shows the region that was used for subsequent analysis by other filters of SUIT payload. Bottom figure:The size of the images shown here corresponds to the white box region shown in the top figure for detail analysis. SUIT observed two bright kernels in various channels marked by arrows. The appearance of these bright kernels in NB02 and NB05 is highly interesting as these two filters observe the solar photosphere, which is lower than the chromospheric emissions Magnesium II and Calcium II. This implies that the effect of this flare affected the layers below the chromosphere. The images are taken in various narrow band (NB) filters of SUIT and are shown with various numbers in the figure. These corresponds to the wavelengths 214 nm (NB01), 276 nm (NB02), 279 nm (NB03), 280 nm (NB04), 283 nm (NB05), 300 nm (NB06), 388 nm (NB07), 396 nm (NB08). While scientists and researchers have studied solar flares with data obtained from other space missions,observations in NUV band were nearly non-existentdue to a lack of dedicated space telescopes in this wavelength band. As mentioned before, ground based telescopes cannot make these measurements as the UV radiation gets absorbed by the Earth’s atmosphere. Aditya-L1’sSUIT instrument is now filling this gap, providing first-of-its-kind insights in understanding solar flare dynamics. The above findings are published inThe Astrophysical Journal Letters, one of the world’s leading astrophysics journals (DOI 10.3847/2041-8213/adb0be). Looking Ahead With Aditya-L1 instruments fully operational for science, the mission is set to revolutionize our understanding of the Sun and its influence on space weather. The initial findings from Aditya-L1 instruments are just the beginning of what could be a new era in solar physics, with India leading the way in uncovering the Sun’s deepest secrets."

"event/PRL_Scientists_Discovered_a_Dense_Sub-Saturn_Using_PARAS-2_Spectrograph_at_Mt_Abu_Telescope","has_description","February 12, 2025 The scientists of the Physical Research Laboratory (PRL), Ahmedabad, have discovered a new exoplanet, TOI-6038A b, a dense sub-Saturn size with a mass of 78.5 Earth masses and a radius of 6.41 Earth radii in a wide binary system. The planet orbits a bright, metal-rich F-type star every 5.83 days in a circular orbit. The TOI-6038A b lies in the transition region between Neptune-like and gas giant exoplanets, called as “Sub-Saturn,” a category absent in our solar system, providing a unique opportunity to study planetary formation and evolution. This discovery marks the second exoplanet discovery using the state-of-the-art PARAS-2 spectrograph attached to the 2.5-meter telescope at PRL's Mount Abu Observatory at Gurushikhar, Mt. Abu. Furthermore, it is the fifth exoplanet detection using the combined efforts of the PARAS-1 and PARAS-2 spectrographs. It highlights India's growing expertise in advanced astronomical instrumentation, with the PARAS-2 spectrograph being the highest-resolution stabilized radial velocity (RV) spectrograph in Asia.Precise Radial-Velocity data from PARAS-2, which was used to measure the mass of the planet, along with high-spatial resolution speckle imaging from the PRL's 2.5-meter telescope, were thus absolutely crucial in validating the planetary nature of the transit signal and hence the discovery. TOI-6038A b has a high density (1.62 g/cm³), placing it among the dense sub-Saturns believed to form through unique mechanisms such as high-eccentricity tidal migration (HEM) or early disk-driven migration. Its host star, TOI-6038A, is part of a binary system, accompanied by a K-type star, TOI-6038B, located 3217 AU away. This wide binary companion, along with the planet’s density and orbital characteristics, raises intriguing questions about its formation and migration. While the companion could influence the planet's orbit via secular perturbations, initial analyses suggest these effects may not fully explain its close-in orbit. Notably, this is only the fifth sub-Saturn exoplanet discovered in a binary system. The preliminary analysis of the internal structure of TOI-6038A b is suggestive of a massive rocky core of about 3/4th (0.75) of its total mass and the remaining mass of the H/He envelope. This offers valuable insights into the transition between terrestrial planets and gas giants. The system's brightness makes it an excellent candidate for atmospheric characterization and spin-orbit alignment studies, which could refine theories on exoplanet migration. Additionally, the search for undetected companions in this system may further illuminate the factors driving its evolution. Details of Paper: S. Baliwal, R. Sharma, A. Chakraborty, et al.

These tests are essential towards ensuring readiness of the entire communications architecture and validation of compatibility of ISRO’s systems with external ground stations before undertaking Gaganyaan missions. This requires integrated operation of the Gaganyaan onboard Telemetry, Tracking & Command (TTC), Data Handling, Audio/Video Systems with the external Ground Station. With the successful accomplishment of these RFCT jointly with ESA, end-to-end compatibility between ISRO’s Gaganyaan Orbital Module communications systems and ESA’s Ground station network has been demonstrated. Ensuring seamless communication between Mission Control Centre and Gaganyaan Orbital Module is vital for the mission success. This is essential for successful accomplishment of mission operations in human space missions such as communication with onboard Crew, monitoring of various onboard systems of the Orbital Module as well as commanding operations by a team of ground based Flight Controllers. In order to provide maximal communication coverage during the Gaganyaan missions, ISRO will be utilising is own capabilities as well as external ground station support from other agencies across the world. This cooperative activity was enabled through a Technical Implementing Plan (TIP) for providing Ground Tracking Support for Gaganyaan Missions signed by both ISRO and ESA in December,2024."

This test was carried out in the High Altitude Test Facility at ISRO Propulsion Complex, Mahendragiri, Tamil Nadu. During this test, the ignition of the engine Thrust Chamber was carried out with a multi-element igniter in vacuum, under the tank pressure conditions that are expected to prevail at the time of restarting the cryogenic engine in flight.The performance of the engine and the facility during the test was normal and as expected. Restarting a cryogenic engine is inherently complex and as part of the studies related to the restart operation, ISRO is exploring the initiation of turbopumps in bootstrap mode rather than the stored gas system. In this approach, both the thrust chamber and gas generator are expected to re-ignite under tank head conditions. ISRO has outlined a series of tests aimed at engine starts in bootstrap mode towards enhancing the capability for multiple cryogenic engine restarts during flight. Previously, the  engine ignition trial using multi-element igniter was carried out under ground conditions outside the vacuum chamber. The engine isalready qualified to operate for thrust levels ranging from 19t to 22t in flight with single start and is qualified for Gaganyaan mission. The engine was developed by Liquid Propulsion Systems Centre of ISRO. Vacuum ignition test of CE20 engine using multi element igniter at HAT facility"

"event/Cabinet_approves_the_establishment_of_“Third_Launch_Pad”","has_description","January 16, 2025 (Posted On: 16 JAN 2025 3:05PM by PIB Delhi) The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi today approved the establishmentof the Third Launch Pad (TLP) at Satish Dhawan Space Centre of ISRO at Sriharikota, Andhra Pradesh. The Third Launch Pad project envisages the establishment of the launch infrastructure at Sriharikota,Andhra Pradesh for the Next Generation Launch Vehicles of ISRO and also to support as standby launchpad for the Second Launch Pad at Sriharikota. This will also enhance the launch capacity for future Indianhuman spaceflight missions. The Project is of national importance. Implementation strategy and targets: The TLP is designed to have configuration that is as universal and adaptable as possible that can supportnot only NGLV but also the LVM3 vehicles with Semicryogenic stage as well as scaled up configurationsof NGLV. It will be realized with maximum industry participation fully utilizing ISRO’s experience inestablishing the earlier launch pads and maximally sharing the existing launch complex facilities. TLP is targeted to be established within a duration of 48 months or 4 years. Expenditure involved: The total fund requirement is Rs. 3984.86 Crore and includes the establishment of the Launch Pad and theassociated facilities. Number of beneficiaries: The Project will boost the Indian Space ecosystem by enabling higher launch frequencies and the nationalcapacity to undertake human spaceflight & space exploration missions. Background: As on today, Indian Space Transportation Systems are completely reliant on two launch pads viz. FirstLaunch Pad (FLP) & Second Launch Pad (SLP). FLP was realized 30 years ago for PSLV and continuesto provide launch support for PSLV & SSLV. SLP was established primarily for GSLV & LVM3 and alsofunctions as standby for PSLV. SLP has been operational for almost 20 years and has enhanced the launchcapacity towards enabling some commercial missions of PSLV/LVM3 along with the national missionsincluding the Chandrayaan-3 mission. SLP is also getting ready to launch the human rated LVM3 for theGaganyaan missions. The expanded vision of Indian Space Programme during the Amrit Kaal including the Bharatiya AntarikshStation (BAS) by 2035 & an Indian Crewed Lunar Landing by 2040 requires a new generation of heavierlaunch vehicles with new propulsion systems, which cannot be met by the existing launch pads. Theexpeditious establishment of a Third Launch Pad to cater to a heavier class of Next Generation LaunchVehicles and as a stand by for SLP is highly essential so as to meet the evolving space transportationrequirements for another 25-30 years."

"event/CROPS:_A_Leap_in_Space_Biological_Experiments","has_description","January 07, 2025 Growing plants from seed in space under micro gravity is an important milestone for space biological research, to produce food in space and as an engaging activity for the astronauts in space during long duration manned missions. CROPS stands for Compact Research Module for Orbital Plant Studies which is an unmanned experimental module designed to develop ISRO’s capabilities for growing and sustaining plants in space. CROPS first mission (CROPS – 1) is designed to demonstrate germination of a seed and growth of plant up to two leaves stage in space. It is an airtight container of diameter 300mm and height 450mm simulating earth like environment in space except gravity. Conceptual image of CROPS Module                                         and Electronics assembly A neutral clay soil medium in pellet form having high porosity to absorb and retain water is used in CROPS – 1 for the seed to spread its roots. The soil medium can be sterilized by heating at high temperature to neutralize microbes, fungus, spores etc. without losing any of its functional properties. The soil is premixed with a slow release fertilizer (activated by water) in a measured quantity to provide nutrients to the plant in a controlled manner over a period of time. The soil is tightly packed in four chambers (with two seeds each) covered by a silicon foam layer followed by a cover plate on the top to provide sufficient compression to the soil. Each seed is pasted on to a polypropylene tissue and glued together using an organic gum. This gum holds the seed rigidly in position until it is wetted by water. The seed also has to be thoroughly sterilized using ethanol before pasting to avoid contamination.  The pasted tissue strip is inserted into the soil medium through a slit in the silicon foam and the cover plate. This mechanism of seed fixing helps the seed to survive the high vibrations and shock levels experienced during launch. In addition, CROPS – 1 also has vibration isolators to protect the module from vibration and shock felt during launch. The CROPS - 1 container is sealed in a clean room environment after inserting the tissue strips, and the chamber will have earth like atmospheric composition with 20.9% oxygen, 400 - 600 ppm of carbon dioxide, 50 to 60% humidity and temperature of 25 to 30 degree Celsius. Practically in this chamber, the seed has all constituents for germination except water. Pure filtered drinking water is stored in small pressurized tank under the CROPS -1 module and water is isolated from the soil medium using an electric valve. From the valve, water is carried in small metallic tubes, which comes out through the perforations all around the tubes. The water coming out of the tubes is absorbed by the porous soil medium due to capillary action. Once in orbit, the experiment starts through a telecommand issued from ground, which opens an electric valve thereby admitting water to soil. The tissue strips also absorbs water by capillary action from the soil, the seed gets soaked and germination starts. During germination, based on ground trials, carbon dioxide levels start to increase and oxygen levels start to decrease during the process. After the development of the first green leaves, photosynthesis starts and carbon dioxide levels start to decrease and oxygen levels will start to increase. The plants will stop growing once the available carbon dioxide levels in sealed chamber goes very low. There are sensors with in the module to measure the concentration of carbon dioxide & oxygen, pressure, temperature, relative humidity and soil moisture. These sensors are powered by an electronics module and the data is acquired and sent to ground by telemetry during visible orbits. A high resolution camera with associated electronics is provide inside at the top of the module to observe the continuous growth of the plant and capture images at periodic intervals. During photosynthesis, plants require sufficient illumination mostly in the Photosynthetically Active Radiation (PAR) spectrum (400 to 700 nm). Four warm LEDs and four cool LEDs are provided at the top of the chamber to provide the necessary PAR and also illumination during image capture. The lights are programmed to be ON for 16 hours and OFF for 8 hours simulating day and night conditions for the plant. Light duration can be changed based on various requirements. Every seed has an ideal temperature for germination and growth and this has to be maintained in the CROPS module. In space, since the external temperature is 4 kelvin the temperature inside the module is maintained within 20 to 30 deg Celsius by using tape type heaters temperature sensors, and  multi-layer insulation (MLI) to prevent heat loss from the module. The electronics module will switch on the heater when the lower temperature limit is reached and the temperature will slowly start to increase. The heater is switched off automatically when the upper temperature limit is reached. The temperature limits and sensors can be used in various configurations as per the specific experiment requirement. CROPS – 1 was flown in PSLV C60 mission in POEM 4 payload to demonstrate germination of a seed and sustenance up to two leaves stage in space for 5 to 7 days.  Cowpea (Scientific name: Vigna Unguiculata) was chosen based on ground trials on a variety of seeds due to its shorter germination time. After launch and main satellite separation, POEM platform was lowered to 350 km orbit and CROPS – 1 payload was switched on. All system parameters were found normal and the temperature was regulated precisely between 20 to 30 deg Celsius. Approximately after 90 minutes, water was injected successfully into the soil medium by operating the electric valve from ground. Data was acquired during subsequent orbits, which indicated carbon dioxide levels rising indicating germination of the seeds. On the fourth day, seeds sprouting out from the enclosed tissue strips was observed. On the fifth day, two leaves were visible on spouted seeds indicating successful accomplishment of the objectives. CROPS Module flown                                     in POEM-4 The next phase of CROPS will be for longer duration (30 to 45 days) envisaging plant growth beyond two leaves stage with active control system to regulate percentage of carbon dioxide, oxygen, relative humidity, soil moisture and temperature for sustained growth of plants in space.

"event/PSLV_C60/SPADEX_Mission_:_SpaDeX_Deployed!_Successful_separation_of_SpaDeX_satellites_marks_another_milestone_in_India's_space_journey","has_description","SpaDeX MissionHome/SpaDeX Mission December 21, 2024 SpaDeX mission is a cost-effective technology demonstrator mission for the demonstration of in-space                     docking using two small spacecraft launched by PSLV. This technology is essential for India's space                     ambitions such as Indian on Moon, sample return from the Moon, the building and operation of                     Bharatiya Antariksh Station (BAS), etc. In-space docking technology is essential when multiple                     rocket launches are required to achieve common mission objectives. Through this mission, India is                     marching towards becoming the fourth country in the world to have space docking technology. Objectives: The primary objective of the SpaDeX mission is to develop and demonstrate the technology needed for                     rendezvous, docking, and undocking of two small spacecraft (SDX01, which is the Chaser, and SDX02,                     the Target, nominally) in a low-Earth circular orbit. Secondary objectives include: More Details Mission Concept: The SpaDeX mission consists of two small spacecraft (about 220 kg each) to be launched by PSLV-C60,                     independently and simultaneously, into a 470 km circular orbit at 55° inclination, with a local time                     cycle of about 66 days. The demonstrated precision of the PSLV vehicle will be utilized to give a                     small relative velocity between the Target and Chaser spacecraft at the time of separation from the                     launch vehicle. This incremental velocity will allow the Target spacecraft to build a 10-20 km                     inter-satellite separation with respect to the Chaser within a day. At this point, the relative                     velocity between the Target will be compensated using the propulsion system of the Target                     spacecraft. At the end of this drift arrest maneuver, the Target and Chaser will be in the same orbit with                     identical velocity but separated by about 20 km, known as Far Rendezvous. With a similar strategy of                     introducing and then compensating for a small relative velocity between the two spacecraft, the                     Chaser will approach the Target with progressively reduced inter-satellite distances of 5 km, 1.5                     km, 500 m, 225 m, 15 m, and 3 m, ultimately leading to the docking of the two spacecraft. After                     successful docking and rigidization, electrical power transfer between the two satellites will be                     demonstrated before undocking and separation of the two satellites to start the operation of their                     respective payloads for the expected mission life of up to two years. New Technologies: The indigenous technologies developed for enabling this docking mission are as follows: In addition, SpaDeX, because of its small size and mass, is even more challenging due to the finer                     precision required for the rendezvous and docking maneuvers compared to docking two large                     spacecraft. This mission will be a forerunner for autonomous docking needed for future lunar                     missions like Chandrayaan-4 without the support of GNSS from Earth. Docking Mechanism: The docking mechanism is a low-impact docking system (approach velocity is in the order of 10 mm/s),                     androgynous (docking systems are identical for both spacecraft, Chaser & Target), and is a                     peripheral docking system (concept similar to the International Docking System Standard used by                     other agencies for human missions). The mechanism is smaller (450 mm) with one degree of freedom for                     extension and uses two motors compared to the IDSS (800 mm) on a hexapod with 24 motors. Multiple                     test beds were established to test the hardware and software simulation of the docking kinematics to                     verify and finalise the docking approach parameters. Sensor Suite: The additional sensor suite in this mission includes Laser Range Finder (LRF) and Corner Cube Retro                     Reflectors to work for a range of 6000 to 200 m for determining range (R). The set of Rendezvous                     Sensors (RS) is used in the range of 2000 to 250 m and from 250-10 m. RS provides the relative                     position (x, y, z) while LRF determines both relative position and velocity independently. Proximity and Docking Sensor (PDS) provides relative position and velocity over a range of 30 m to                     0.4 m. Laser Diodes (LDs) are used as targets for RS & PDS. A video monitor is used in the 20 to 0.5                     m range and it will capture the video of the docking event. A Mechanism Entry Sensor (MES) is used                     from 8 cm to 4 cm to detect chaser entry into the target spacecraft during docking. Multiple test                     beds were used to calibrate and validate these sensors before accepting them for the mission. ISL-Enabled GNSS-Based RODP: Like all ISRO satellites in low-Earth orbit, both the SpaDeX spacecraft carry a differential                     GNSS-based Satellite Positioning System (SPS), which provides PNT (Position, Navigation, and Timing)                     solutions for the satellites. In SpaDeX, a novel RODP processor is included in the SPS receiver,                     which allows accurate determination of the relative position and velocity of the Chaser and the                     Target. By subtracting the carrier phase measurements from the same GNSS satellites in both Chaser                     and Target SPS receivers, highly accurate relative states of the two satellites are determined. The                     VHF/UHF transceivers in both satellites aid this process by transferring the GNSS satellite                     measurements from one satellite to the other. Hardware and software test beds, including closed-loop                     verifications, were carried out to characterise the RODP performance. Rendezvous and Docking Algorithms: Up to an inter-satellite distance (ISD) of 5 km, standard orbit maintenance and attitude control                     algorithms employed in ISRO LEO spacecraft are used. As the spacecraft are in circular orbit, and                     any addition or reduction of velocity to the satellites will result in orbit change, the V-bar                     strategy using n-Pulse, Glideslope and PV guidance algorithms are employed to reduce the ISD between                     the satellites, hold at fixed ISDs to evaluate the sensors and software, and finally docking. These                     algorithms were converted into software for achieving the rendezvous and docking. These software                     solutions were tested and validated in multiple digital, hardware-in-loop, onboard-in-loop,                     software-in-loop, and robotic simulations. Post-Docking Activities: After the docking and undocking events, the spacecrafts will be separated and used for application                     missions. Spacecraft Development: The SpaDeX spacecraft were designed and realized by the UR Rao Satellite Centre (URSC) with the                     support of other ISRO centers (VSSC, LPSC, SAC, IISU, and LEOS). The spacecraft, in its orbital                     phase, will be controlled from ISTRAC using ISRO ground stations and other externally hired ground                     stations. The full integration and testing of the satellite were carried out at M/s Ananth                     Technologies, Bangalore, under the supervision of URSC. Presently, after completing all tests and                     clearances, the spacecraft has moved from URSC to SDSC and is undergoing preparations for launch. More Details"

ETA IDEA-V2 11. Ionosphere TEC Measurement using NavIC (PLASDEM) This payload is jointly developed by SPL and IISU. The objective is to measure                                         the Plasmaspheric Electron Content and its longitudinal variations using a                                         dual-frequency NavIC receiver onboard POEM-4, primarily over the Indian region                                         (NavIC regional coverage). It also uses carrier phase measurements from NavIC                                         signals for ionosphere delay/TEC measurement. The plasmasphere of the Earth’s                                         atmosphere is not well-characterized due to a lack of sufficient measurements in                                         the region of ~350 km altitude. This is one of the first attempts to use an                                         onboard receiver with NavIC L1 and L5 frequencies for ionospheric delay                                         measurement to study the plasmasphere. 12.

Amity Plant Experimental Module in Space (APEMS) The APEMS payload is developed by Amity University, Mumbai, and is designed to                                         study growth-related changes in plant callus using the ‘Spinacia oleracea’ model                                         under microgravity (space environment) and Earth gravity (natural environment).                                         Two parallel experiments will be carried out simultaneously—one on POEM-4 in                                         space and one on the ground at Amity University. The sunlight and nutrients                                         required for the plant callus will be simulated using LEDs inside the module,                                         with nutrients supplied by a gel medium. If the green callus dies, it changes                                         colour. The coloration and horizontal growth of the plant will be captured by a                                         camera placed on top of the module. Additionally, pressure, humidity, and CO2                                         sensors are integrated into the imaging and sensor unit of the payload. The                                         experiment’s outcome will provide insights into how higher plants sense the                                         direction of gravity and light, and ameliorate itself to respond, to                                         gravitational stress, and regulate their direction of growth, a basic need for                                         boosting plant growth on Earth and during prolonged spaceflight missions.

"event/SpaDeX:_India's_Pioneering_Space_Docking_Demonstrator_for_Future_Space_Exploration","has_description","SpaDeX MissionHome/SpaDeX Mission December 21, 2024 SpaDeX mission is a cost-effective technology demonstrator mission for the demonstration of in-space                     docking using two small spacecraft launched by PSLV. This technology is essential for India's space                     ambitions such as Indian on Moon, sample return from the Moon, the building and operation of                     Bharatiya Antariksh Station (BAS), etc. In-space docking technology is essential when multiple                     rocket launches are required to achieve common mission objectives. Through this mission, India is                     marching towards becoming the fourth country in the world to have space docking technology. Objectives: The primary objective of the SpaDeX mission is to develop and demonstrate the technology needed for                     rendezvous, docking, and undocking of two small spacecraft (SDX01, which is the Chaser, and SDX02,                     the Target, nominally) in a low-Earth circular orbit. Secondary objectives include: More Details Mission Concept: The SpaDeX mission consists of two small spacecraft (about 220 kg each) to be launched by PSLV-C60,                     independently and simultaneously, into a 470 km circular orbit at 55° inclination, with a local time                     cycle of about 66 days. The demonstrated precision of the PSLV vehicle will be utilized to give a                     small relative velocity between the Target and Chaser spacecraft at the time of separation from the                     launch vehicle. This incremental velocity will allow the Target spacecraft to build a 10-20 km                     inter-satellite separation with respect to the Chaser within a day. At this point, the relative                     velocity between the Target will be compensated using the propulsion system of the Target                     spacecraft. At the end of this drift arrest maneuver, the Target and Chaser will be in the same orbit with                     identical velocity but separated by about 20 km, known as Far Rendezvous. With a similar strategy of                     introducing and then compensating for a small relative velocity between the two spacecraft, the                     Chaser will approach the Target with progressively reduced inter-satellite distances of 5 km, 1.5                     km, 500 m, 225 m, 15 m, and 3 m, ultimately leading to the docking of the two spacecraft. After                     successful docking and rigidization, electrical power transfer between the two satellites will be                     demonstrated before undocking and separation of the two satellites to start the operation of their                     respective payloads for the expected mission life of up to two years. New Technologies: The indigenous technologies developed for enabling this docking mission are as follows: In addition, SpaDeX, because of its small size and mass, is even more challenging due to the finer                     precision required for the rendezvous and docking maneuvers compared to docking two large                     spacecraft. This mission will be a forerunner for autonomous docking needed for future lunar                     missions like Chandrayaan-4 without the support of GNSS from Earth. Docking Mechanism: The docking mechanism is a low-impact docking system (approach velocity is in the order of 10 mm/s),                     androgynous (docking systems are identical for both spacecraft, Chaser & Target), and is a                     peripheral docking system (concept similar to the International Docking System Standard used by                     other agencies for human missions). The mechanism is smaller (450 mm) with one degree of freedom for                     extension and uses two motors compared to the IDSS (800 mm) on a hexapod with 24 motors. Multiple                     test beds were established to test the hardware and software simulation of the docking kinematics to                     verify and finalise the docking approach parameters. Sensor Suite: The additional sensor suite in this mission includes Laser Range Finder (LRF) and Corner Cube Retro                     Reflectors to work for a range of 6000 to 200 m for determining range (R). The set of Rendezvous                     Sensors (RS) is used in the range of 2000 to 250 m and from 250-10 m. RS provides the relative                     position (x, y, z) while LRF determines both relative position and velocity independently. Proximity and Docking Sensor (PDS) provides relative position and velocity over a range of 30 m to                     0.4 m. Laser Diodes (LDs) are used as targets for RS & PDS. A video monitor is used in the 20 to 0.5                     m range and it will capture the video of the docking event. A Mechanism Entry Sensor (MES) is used                     from 8 cm to 4 cm to detect chaser entry into the target spacecraft during docking. Multiple test                     beds were used to calibrate and validate these sensors before accepting them for the mission. ISL-Enabled GNSS-Based RODP: Like all ISRO satellites in low-Earth orbit, both the SpaDeX spacecraft carry a differential                     GNSS-based Satellite Positioning System (SPS), which provides PNT (Position, Navigation, and Timing)                     solutions for the satellites. In SpaDeX, a novel RODP processor is included in the SPS receiver,                     which allows accurate determination of the relative position and velocity of the Chaser and the                     Target. By subtracting the carrier phase measurements from the same GNSS satellites in both Chaser                     and Target SPS receivers, highly accurate relative states of the two satellites are determined. The                     VHF/UHF transceivers in both satellites aid this process by transferring the GNSS satellite                     measurements from one satellite to the other. Hardware and software test beds, including closed-loop                     verifications, were carried out to characterise the RODP performance. Rendezvous and Docking Algorithms: Up to an inter-satellite distance (ISD) of 5 km, standard orbit maintenance and attitude control                     algorithms employed in ISRO LEO spacecraft are used. As the spacecraft are in circular orbit, and                     any addition or reduction of velocity to the satellites will result in orbit change, the V-bar                     strategy using n-Pulse, Glideslope and PV guidance algorithms are employed to reduce the ISD between                     the satellites, hold at fixed ISDs to evaluate the sensors and software, and finally docking. These                     algorithms were converted into software for achieving the rendezvous and docking. These software                     solutions were tested and validated in multiple digital, hardware-in-loop, onboard-in-loop,                     software-in-loop, and robotic simulations. Post-Docking Activities: After the docking and undocking events, the spacecrafts will be separated and used for application                     missions. Spacecraft Development: The SpaDeX spacecraft were designed and realized by the UR Rao Satellite Centre (URSC) with the                     support of other ISRO centers (VSSC, LPSC, SAC, IISU, and LEOS). The spacecraft, in its orbital                     phase, will be controlled from ISTRAC using ISRO ground stations and other externally hired ground                     stations. The full integration and testing of the satellite were carried out at M/s Ananth                     Technologies, Bangalore, under the supervision of URSC. Presently, after completing all tests and                     clearances, the spacecraft has moved from URSC to SDSC and is undergoing preparations for launch. More Details"

"event/Gaganyaan-G1_Launch_campaign_commences:_Human_Rated_LVM3_assembly_starts_at_SDSC_for_the_first_un-crewed_flight","has_description","December 18, 2024 It was on December 18. 2014, that the Indian Coast Guard recovered the Crew Module from the turbulent seas of Bay of Bengal, approximately 1600 km from SDSC-SHAR. On the morning of the same day, LVM3-X in its maiden flight had lifted a Crew Module of mass of 3775 kg (LVM3-X/CARE mission) into a suborbital altitude of 126 km from where it was controlled using thrusters to orient it for a favourable re-entry. The Crew Module descended using parachutes to have a smooth splash down at the designated location. The Crew Module was developed as part of pre-project activities of Human Spaceflight Project, well before the official Gaganyaan project was approved in 2019. It is a fitting coincidence that ten years later, on the same day, ISRO is gearing up for the first un-crewed mission of Gaganyaan, by commencing the stacking of human-rated LVM3, christened HLVM3, at SDSC-SHAR. ISRO has come a long way from the experimental mission of LVM3-X/CARE mission. The human rated launch vehicle, HLVM3, is derived from LVM3 and designed with enhanced reliability to meet human safety considerations. Additionally, a Crew Escape System (CES) is implemented to ensure crew safety by safe ejection of Crew Module (CM) in a potentially adverse situation.  The CES is operational from the launch pad till its separation after the atmospheric flight regime. HLVM3 is a three-stage vehicle with a payload capacity of about 10 tonnes to LEO. The vehicle is 53 meters tall and weighs 640 tonnes. The vehicle is getting ready for launch with the Crew Module and associated systems undergoing final checks at ISRO centres. The primary objective of the LVM3-X/CARE mission was to validate the vehicle's flight through the atmospheric regime and demonstrate the re-entry of a full-scale Crew Module into Earth's atmosphere. The mission achieved several critical technical milestones, including the flight validation of the LVM3 vehicle, synchronized performance of the paired S200 solid rocket boosters, twin-engine operation of the Vikas engines in L110 stage, control-sharing algorithms across L110 and S200 stages, and complex separation mechanisms. The success also validated the entire integration, assembly, testing, and launch servicing processes, as well as the mission design and simulation cycles, ensuring readiness for future missions. The CARE experiment itself served as a platform to evaluate the aerothermal performance of the Crew Module and validate critical re-entry technologies. It successfully demonstrated blunt-body re-entry aerodynamics, thermal protection systems, parachute-based deceleration mechanisms, and recovery logistics, providing invaluable insights for further developments. The success of the LVM3-X/CARE mission was instrumental in ISRO's journey toward self-reliance in launching heavier satellites. LVM3 has since completed seven successive successful launches. The insights gained from the CARE mission have also been pivotal in shaping ISRO's human spaceflight program. Iterations in the Crew Module design, along with subsequent pad abort tests, air-drop tests and test vehicle flights, are built on the foundational data provided by CARE. The human-rating of LVM3 has been completed and all systems have been tested for enhanced reliability. Ground tests and flight tests in off-nominal conditions have ensured the performance of these systems in line with human safety requirements. The addition of the highly reliable Crew Escape System (CES) has further increased confidence for the manned missions planned by ISRO. Escape provision exists for the crew during all phases of ascent till injection of the module into orbit. As India prepares for its maiden human spaceflight under the Gaganyaan programme, the legacy of the LVM3-X/CARE mission becomes more relevant. The Crew Module designed with enhanced safety margins and multiple redundancies, will fly aboard the Human-rated LVM3, ensuring the safety of the Gaganyatris. The data gained through the un-crewed flights will be instrumental for the success of the manned missions. Further, the experience from Gaganyaan programme will play a vital role in the construction and operationalization of the Bharatiya Antariksh Station (BAS). This ambitious endeavour reflects ISRO's long-term vision and foresight to leverage established heritage for advancing India's space sector. Dr. S Somanath, Mission Director of the LVM3-X/CARE mission now serves as the Secretary of the Department of Space and Chairman of ISRO, while Dr. S Unnikrishnan Nair, the Payload Director of the LVM3-X/ CARE mission became the founding Director of the Human Space Flight Centre (HSFC), Bengaluru and now leads the Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre (VSSC), Thiruvananthapuram. At 8.45 Hrs on 18thDecember, 2024 at SDSC, the stacking of the nozzle end segment with full flex seal nozzle of the S200 motor took place, thus commencing the official launch campaign of the HLVM3-G1 / OM-1 mission. Preparation of both the S200 motors will now take place with the assembly of segments, control systems and avionics. L110 and C32 stages for the HLVM3 are ready at the launch complex.

"event/Charting_the_Shadows_of_Time:_Sundial_at_VSSC_Space_Museum","has_description","December 17, 2024 Sundials are horological devices that indicate the time of day using the shadow cast by the apparent position of the sun. Used as early as 1500 BCE in Ancient Egypt and Babylon, sundials were among the only means to measure time prior to the advent of modern-day clocks. India has been a pioneer in the science and engineering of sundials, as evident from the 18th century time-keeping instruments in Jantar Mantars across the subcontinent, including the Vrihat Samrat Yantra of Jaipur, the largest stone sundial in the world. Although rendered practically obsolete by modern technology, sundials remain fascinating scientific tools, offering insights into not only the history and evolution of science, but also the celestial mechanics and orbital motions of the Earth. In November 2024, a team consisting of members from SPL, TTDG and CMD of VSSC successfully designed and installed an accurate and fully functional sundial at the Rocket Garden of VSSC Space Museum, Thumba (8.53°N, 76.86°E). Unlike common sundials that only indicate the local solar time, this is a “Polar Sundial with Analemmatic Correction”, which accurately gives the Indian Standard Time (IST) as well as the date. Being among the exclusive few analemma-corrected sundials in the world, this system features a unique design that enables simultaneous time and date reading throughout the year using a single dial and pointer. The sundial adopts a Polar configuration, with the dial plate (of size 4 ft x 4.2 ft) affixed on an acrylic wedge structure having a precise inclination of 8.53° as dictated by the local latitude of Thumba. Giving the quintessential feel of TERLS, a 3D-printed model of the RH200 sounding rocket (~1.6 ft tall; 1:7.4 scaled-down model) is used as the style for casting the shadow, fixed perpendicular to the inclined plate. The entire sundial structure is mounted on a 6 ft dia. concrete platform, ensuring exact alignment with the true North-South direction. The direction of the True Geographic North was geometrically determined by the Method of Perpendicular Bisectors (using the symmetric motion of the sun about the local meridian), avoiding errors from relying on the conventional magnetic compass for north determination. Thus, in this configuration the sundial plate is exactly parallel to the Earth’s rotation axis (polar axis), with the rocket-shaped style parallel to the Earth’s equatorial plane, pointing to the intersection of the celestial equator and local meridian. Typical sundials have straight hour lines that can only indicate the local time at the installation site, which can be significantly different from the standard clock-time. This is not of much use today, with the Indian Standard Time (IST) being the accepted standard for civil time throughout the country. To obtain the actual time as seen on our watches, a systematic correction is incorporated to account for the sun’s apparent seasonal motions. During the course of the year, the sun exhibits seasonal variations in its path due to 2 reasons: (i) Earth’s axial tilt of (~23.44º with the ecliptic) results in an apparent north-south motion of the sun about the equator; (ii) Earth’s orbital eccentricity (~0.0167) results in an apparent east-west motion of the sun due to the speeding up or slowing down of the orbital motion. In combination, the two phenomena lead to an annual figure-of-8 motion of the sun in the sky, called the “Analemma” (discernible upon viewing the sun at the same time of day over one year), which manifests as the Equation of Time: the difference between local solar time measured by sundials and mean time measured by modern clocks. To capture this systematic behaviour, the sundial design is enhanced by introducing inverted analemma curves instead of straight hour lines. This built-in “Analemmatic Correction” incorporates the Equation of Time into the sundial, automatically converting local solar time to mean solar time throughout the year. To further obtain the Indian Standard Time (defined at 82.5ºE longitude, passing through Mirzapur, UP), an additional longitude correction is applied, shifting the curves westward by ~22.53 minutes, as dictated by the local longitude of Thumba. This enables the sundial to give the exact Indian Standard Time (IST) as seen on clocks and watches all across India. The sundial uses red and blue colours to indicate which halves of the analemma curves are to be used in each season, enabling round-the-year measurements. The added advantage of analemmatic correction is that the sundial is now capable of indicating the date: the horizontal declination curves indicate the start of each month, with the northern & southern extremes marking the solstices, and the central line marking the equinoxes. To improve readability, the analemma curves are limited to 15-minute intervals, and declination curves to the 1st of each month, though a simple visual interpolation can indicate the times and dates that fall in between. The sundial design was validated using an in-house developed scaled-down prototype model, following which the finalized design was externally fabricated. The full-scale system was installed on 27 November 2024 and extensively tested under solar illumination, confirming a near-exact match of the indicated time with the IST (accurate to within one minute), as well as the date of the year. On 29 November 2024, the sundial was demonstrated to Dr. S. Somanath, Chairman, ISRO, during his visit to the VSSC Space Museum, in the presence of Dr. S. Unnikrishnan Nair, Director, VSSC, along with Dr. Divya S. Iyer IAS, MD, Vizhinjam International Seaport, Shri T. P. Sreenivasan, former Indian Ambassador, and other dignitaries. Chairman appreciated the unique capability for simultaneous time and date measurements from such a simple system. The sundial is open to visitors at the VSSC Space Museum, who are welcome to experience it, preferably during clear-sky sunny conditions. Presently, this is the only reported analemma-corrected sundial in India, that gives both the Indian Standard Time and date, with pointers indicating the polar & equatorial planes, and providing insights on the annual migration of the Sun and orbital motions of the Earth. The system is sure to strike a chord with curious minds, standing as yet another testimony to the marvels of our cosmos.

"event/Preparing_for_inflight_re-ignition,_full_nozzle_cryogenic_engine_(CE20)_undergoes_test_outside_vacuum_chamber.","has_description","December 11, 2024 This test was done with multi element ignitor and water injection system at nozzle divergent to prevent flow separation. ISRO has successfully carried out the sea level hot test of its CE20 Cryogenic Engine featuring a nozzle area ratio of 100 at ISRO Propulsion Complex, Mahendragiri, Tamil Nadu on November 29, 2024. Performance of a multi-element igniter that is required for engine restart capability was also demonstrated during this test. Testing the CE20 engine at sea level poses considerable challenges, primarily due to the high area ratio nozzle which has an exit pressure of approximately 50 mbar. The main concern during testing at sea level include flow separation inside the nozzle, which leads to severe vibrations and thermal problems at the flow separation plane leading to possible mechanical damage of the nozzle. In order to mitigate this issue, the flight acceptance tests for CE20 engines are currently being performed at the High-Altitude Test (HAT) facility, thereby adding complexity to the acceptance testing procedure. To reduce the complexity related to the testing at HAT, a sea level test utilizing an innovative Nozzle Protection System was devised that has paved the way for a cost-effective and less complex procedure for acceptance testing of the cryogenic engines. Restart of a cryogenic engine is a complex process. Major challenges are vacuum ignition without nozzle closure and use of multi-element igniter. ISRO has demonstrated vacuum ignition of CE20 engine without nozzle closure in earlier ground tests. In this test, the multi-element igniter performance was also evaluated, wherein, only the first element was activated, while the health of the other two elements were monitored. During this test, both the engine and facility performance were normal, and the required engine performance parameters were achieved as anticipated. The indigenous CE20 cryogenic engine developed by the Liquid Propulsion Systems Centre of ISRO is powering the upper stage of the LVM3 launch vehicle and has been qualified to operate at a thrust level of 19 tonnes. This engine has successfully powered the upper stage of six LVM3 missions so far. Recently, the engine was qualified for the Gaganyaan mission with a thrust level of 20 tonnes and also to an uprated thrust level of 22 tonnes for the future C32 stage, towards enhancing the payload capability of LVM3 launch vehicle.

"event/Unlocking_the_Mysteries_of_the_Sun:_Aditya-L1's_Observations_of_a_Coronal_Mass_Ejection","has_description","December 10, 2024 Indian researchers using the Visible Emission Line Coronagraph (VELC) onboard the Aditya-L1 mission have unveiled fascinating details about a solar event that has a profound impact on space weather. Aditya-L1, India's first space-based solar mission, observed a Coronal Mass Ejection (CME)—a massive burst of solar plasma and magnetic fields ejected from the Sun's outer atmosphere. Launched on September 2, 2023, the mission was successfully placed on January 6, 2024 in a halo orbit around the first Sun-Earth Lagrange Point L1, which is about 1.5 million km away from the Earth. Figure: Aditya-L1 spacecraft in clean room with location of VELC payload (left). The image of VELC payload (right). The CME event was observed on July 16, 2024, when a CME, accompanied by a powerful solar flare, erupted from the Sun. Using the VELC, researchers studied the Sun's corona (its outer atmosphere) in great detail, focusing on light emitted at a specific green wavelength of 5303 Å. This unique ""green light,"" caused by iron atoms at incredibly high temperatures in solar corona (over million degrees Celsius), allowed scientists to track the movement of solar material during the CME. Figure: Illustration of Lagrange points of Sun-Earth system and location of Aditya-L1 (schematic image, not drawn to scale) What Is the Sun's Corona and Why Is It Important? The corona is the Sun's outermost layer, extending millions of kilometers into space. It is an extremely hot and glowing region of the Sun, with temperatures around million degrees Celsius—much hotter than the Sun's surface which is around 5,600 degrees Celsius. Why Corona is so hot is one of the biggest mysteries in solar science. Normally, the corona is difficult to see because the Sun’s bright light overwhelms it, but during a solar eclipse, the corona becomes visible as a glowing halo around the Sun. Understanding the corona is crucial because it holds key insights into the Sun's activity and how it affects space weather. What is a Coronal Mass Ejection (CME) and Why Does It Happen? ACoronal Mass Ejection (CME)is a massive release of solar wind and magnetic fields from theSun's corona. During a CME, large amounts ofcharged particles(such as electrons and protons) and plasma are ejected into space at extremely high speeds, often reaching millions of kilometers per hour. When a CME reaches Earth, it can interact with our magnetic field, leading to disturbances that can disruptsatellite communications, GPS systems, andpower grids. CMEs are caused bymagnetic activityin the Sun's corona. The Sun's magnetic field is highly dynamic, constantly changing and shifting. These changes can cause the magnetic field lines to become twisted and stretched. When these magnetic fields suddenly realign or reconnect, they release a tremendous amount of energy, which pushes solar material outward into space, resulting in a CME. This explosive release of energy is often associated with solar flares, but CMEs may occur independently of them as well. The accurate connection between CME andsolar flaresare still a scientific puzzle. Understanding the causes and behavior of CMEs is crucial for predicting their effects on Earth and protecting our technology from space weather hazards. What Did researchers Discover from VELC onboard Aditya-L1? The researchers from Indian Institute of Astrophysics reported the following important observations in a paper titled'New Results on the Onset of a Coronal Mass Ejection from 5303 Å Emission Line Observations with VELC/ADITYA-L1'published in peer reviewed International journal 'The Astrophysical Journal Letter'. The full publication is available at DOI 10.3847/2041-8213/ad8c45. Figure: Images of the west limb of the Sun (where the CME occurred) that were generated using VELC raster scan observations, before and after the CME. It is seen that the coronal structures in the pre-event image have disappeared in the post-event image. This happens in a CME due to ejection of  coronal material from the Sun. In the image the horizontal and vertical axis are represented in Solar radius. The following key observations about July 16, 2024 CME are reported: Figure: The above figure shows the changes in intensity (upper panel), emission line width (middle panel) and plasma velocity (lower panel) as observed from VELC/Aditya-L1 of the CME event of July 16, 2024. (R. Ramesh et al 2024 ApJL 976 L6). Upper panel:Shows the variation of the brightness (or intensity) of the emission line as it changes with time. The observed dip in the brightness of emission line around 13:18 UT indicates the onset of coronal dimming. The coronal dimming occurs because a large amount of solar material is ejected during the CME. This dimming, lasting for about more than 6 hours indicates that the CME has removed significant plasma from the Sun's corona, causing a temporary reduction in brightness in the observed region. Middle panel:Displays the width of the emission line over time. After the CME, the width increased, indicating enhanced turbulence. This may be due to restructuring of coronal magnetic field at the source region of CME after its launch. Lower panel:Shows the Doppler velocity measurements, which measures the speed at which the solar material is moving toward or away from the observer. The Doppler velocity increased to  about +10 km per second after coronal dimming which indicates the plasma is moving away from observer with this speed after CME. TheAditya-L1mission continues to provide invaluable insights into the Sun’s behavior, laying the groundwork for future research and helping us better understand our nearest star.Aditya-L1is not just a scientific achievement but also an inspiration for students and young scientists across the country. It shows the power ofspace researchand the potential for India to contribute in solving scientific challenges through space based research."

The trials were carried out Eastern Naval Command using welldeck ship off the coast of Vishakhapatnam. Well deck in a ship can be flooded with water so that boats, landing crafts, recovered spacecrafts can be taken inside to dock within the ship. Once Crew Module touches down in the sea at the end of the mission, crew have to be recovered in the minimum possible time and with the least discomfort. One of the preferred options is to tow the Crew Module along with the crew inside the well deck of the ship where the crew can come out of the Crew Module comfortably. The trials for carrying out well deck recovery were carried out using a mass and shape simulated Crew Module Mock-up.The sequence of operations for welldeck recovery of Crew Module was carried out by Indian Navy and ISRO during the trials. The sequence include the attachment of the recovery buoy, towing, entering into the well deck ship, positioning of CM on the fixture and draining of the well-deck. This trial validated the overall sequence of operations, ground fixtures and will help in fine tuning Standard Operating Procedures (SOP). This trial is part of the series of recovery trials being carried out by Indian Navy and ISRO to finalise the SOPs for recovery operations for nominal as well as off-nominal conditions.

"event/India's_AstroSat_and_NASA's_Space_Observatories_Capture_Dramatic_Eruptions_from_Stellar_Wreckage_around_a_Massive_Black_Hole","has_description","October 10, 2024 A massive black hole has torn apart one star and is now using that stellar wreckage to pummel another star or smaller black hole that used to be in the clear. This discovery was made using NASA's space observatories—Chandra, HST, NICER, Swift—and IS-RO's AstroSat. It provides astronomers with valuable insights, linking two mysteries where there had previously only been hints of a connection. In 2019, astronomers witnessed the signal of a star that got too close to a black hole and was destroyed by the black hole’s gravitational forces. Once shredded, the star’s re-mains began circling the black hole in a disk in a type of stellar graveyard. Over a few years, however, this disk has expanded outward and is now directly in the path of a star, or possibly a stellar-mass black hole, orbiting the massive black hole at a previously safe distance. The orbiting star is now repeatedly crashing through the debris disk, about once every 48 hours, as it circles. When it does, the collision causes bursts of X-rays that astronomers captured with Chandra. “Imagine a diver repeatedly going into a pool and creating a splash every time she enters the water,” said Matt Nicholl of Queen's University Belfast, United Kingdom, the lead au-thor of the study that appears in the current issue of Nature. “The star in this comparison is like the diver and the disk is the pool, and each time the star strikes the surface it creates a huge 'splash' of gas and X-rays. As the star orbits around the black hole, it does this over and over again.” Scientists have documented many cases where an object gets too close to a black hole and gets torn apart in a single burst of light. Astronomers call these “tidal disruption events” (TDEs). In recent years, astronomers have also discovered a new class of bright flashes from the centers of galaxies, which are detected only in X-rays and repeat many times. These events are also connected to supermassive black holes, but astronomers could not explain what caused the semi-regular bursts of X-rays. They dubbed these “quasi-periodic eruptions,” or QPEs. “There had been feverish speculation that these phenomena were connected, and now we've discovered the proof that they are,” said co-author Dheeraj Pasham of the Massa-chusetts Institute of Technology. “It's like getting a cosmic two-for-one in terms of solving mysteries.” This tidal disruption event now known as AT2019qiz was first discovered by a wide-field optical telescope at the Palomar Observatory, called the Zwicky Transient Facility, in 2019. In 2023, astronomers used both Chandra and NASA's Hubble Space Telescope to study the debris left behind after the tidal disruption had ended. The Chandra data were obtained during three different observations, each separated by about 4 to 5 hours. The total exposure of about 14 hours of Chandra time revealed only a weak signal in the first and last chunk, but a very strong signal in the middle observa-tion. From there Nicholl and collaborators used NASA's Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER) to look frequently at AT2019qiz for repeated X-ray bursts. The NICER data showed that AT2019qiz erupts roughly every 48 hours. Observations from NASA''s Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory and India's AstroSat telescope cemented the finding. The ultraviolet data from Hubble, obtained at the same time as the Chandra observa-tions, allowed the scientists to determine the size of the disk around the supermassive black hole. They found that the disk had become large enough that if any object was or-biting the black hole with a period of about a week or less, it would collide with the disk and cause eruptions. Gulab Dewangan, a co-author from the Pune-based Inter-University Center for Astron-omy & Astrophysics (IUCAA), noted,India's AstroSat mission provides unique UV/X-ray capability for studying such events. AstroSat's Soft X-ray Telescope and the Ultra-Violet Imaging Telescope (UVIT) both detected the source AT2019qiz, but the eruptions were only seen in X-rays. Future sensitive simultaneous X-ray and UV observations of similar eruptions will enable a deeper investigation into their nature."" “This is a huge breakthrough in our understanding of the origin of these regular eruptions,” said Andrew Mummery of Oxford University. “We now realize we need to wait a few years for the eruptions to ‘turn on’ after a star has been torn apart because it takes some time for the disk to spread out far enough to encounter another star.” This result has implications for searching for more quasi-periodic eruptions associated with tidal disruptions. Finding more of these would allow astronomers to measure the prevalence and distances of objects in close orbits around supermassive black holes. Some of these may be excellent targets for the planned future gravitational wave ob-servatories. The paper describing these results is published by Nature in the October 9 issue of the journal. The paper will be available at theURL.

"event/The_upper_stage_of_PSLV-37_which_launched_a_record_number_of_104_satellites_re-enters_the_Earth's_atmosphere_on_6_Oct_2024","has_description","October 08, 2024 PSLV-C37 was launched on 15 Feb 2017 with Cartosat-2D as the main payload along with another 103 satellites as co-passengers, namely INS-1A, INS- 1B, Al-Farabi 1, BGUSAT, DIDO-2, Nayif 1, PEASS, 88 Flock-3p satellites, and 8 Lemur-2 satellites. It created history as the first mission to launch 104 satellites with a single vehicle. After injecting the satellites and passivation, the upper stage (PS4) was left at an orbit of approximately 470x 494 km size. It was regularly tracked by USSPACECOM as an object with NORAD id 42052 and its orbital altitude slowly decayed, primarily due to atmospheric drag effects, as shown below. Since September 2024, IS4OM (ISRO System for Safe and Sustainable Space Operations Management) regularly monitored the orbital decay as part of its regular activities and predicted the re-entry into atmosphere in the first week of October 2024. The orbit had decayed to a size of 134 x148 km, as of 6th the October, 12:45 UTC. As per US Space Command (USSPACECOM) prediction published in Space Track, the re-entry took place at 06 Oct 2024 15:49 UTC (+/-1 minute of uncertainty), while IS4OM prediction also showed that the re-entry would occur on 06 Oct 2024 at 15:48:25 UTC. The corresponding impact point is in North Atlantic Ocean. The atmospheric re-entry of the rocket body within 8 years of its launch is fully compliant with the international debris mitigation guidelines, in particular, the guideline of Inter-Agency Space Debris coordination committee (IADC) that recommends limiting the post-mission orbital life of a defunct object in Low-Earth orbit (LEO) to 25 years. This requirement was met by properly designing passivation sequence which lowered the orbit of PS4 after the injection of the payloads. At present, special initiatives are undertaken to ensure that the residual orbital lifetime of the PSLV upper stages is reduced to 5 years or even less by actively de-orbiting them to lower altitude orbits through engine re-starts, as in PSLV-C38, PSLV-40, PSLV-C43, PSLV-C56, and PSLV-C58 missions. Controlled re-entry of the upper stage is also envisaged for the disposal of the upper stage in future PSLV missions. As part of its longstanding commitment to preserve long term sustainability of outer space activities, ISRO will continue to implement proactive measures to meet the objectives of Debris Free Space Mission (DFSM) by the year 2030."

"event/Union_Cabinet_Approves_India's_Mission_to_Venus,_and_Sample_Return_from_the_Moon","has_description","Mission to the Venus, and to the Moon: Configuration and Scientific ObjectivesHome/ Mission to the Venus, and to the Moon: Configuration and Scientific Objectives Prologue In a historic move, on September 18, 2024, the Union Cabinet of the Government of India has accorded approval for two significant space science missions, viz. the Venus Orbiter Mission (VOM) to study different facets of Venus including its surface and atmosphere, and the Chandrayaan-4 mission, which is meant to collect lunar samples and bring back the same to the Earth. These missions will be major stepping stones to achieve Honb’le Prime Minister’s Space Vision 2047, which envisions India being one of the most impactful space-powers with the Bharatiya Antariksha Station in orbit by year 2035, and Indians having landed on the Moon with indigenous technologies by year 2040. These would necessitate achieving a few technologies like heavy-lift-off launch vehicles, human-rated vehicles, docking technology, high-capacity landers, re-entry technology, to name a few. Technology, along with science, will shape up the country’s space programme roadmap, which has been discussed systematically with the scientists from the national institutes and academia. Speaking about the scientific aspects, India’s planetary exploration programme is driven by the motivations of comparative planetology to study the similarities and dissimilarities between the planets and natural satellites, and exploring the diversities of the Sun-planet interactions. This programme comprises several space missions to study the Moon, Mars, Venus and other members of the solar system, which will, eventually, bring out the detailed perspective of the solar system. Comparative Planetology in India’s Planetary Exploration About 4.5 billion years ago, when the Sun was born out of the condensation of a giant, gaseous dust-cloud system (now called as the solar nebula), more than 99.8 % of the mass of the dust and gas was consumed to make the Sun. Whatever remained, a major share of that was utilized to make the Jupiter, the biggest planet of our solar system. The remaining amount of material was used up in the making of the other giant planets like Saturn, Neptune and Uranus, plus the terrestrial planets (Mercury, Venus and Earth), the natural satellites and other members of the solar system. Interestingly, despite being born together, today the planets and natural satellites in our solar system have significant differences among themselves, as each of them evolved in different ways. Thus, the comparison among them became a significant tool to understand the evolution of the solar system, as well as the relative importance of several factors that steer the paths of evolution of its members. The major factors that had implications on the present-day diversity of the planetary bodies include the distance from the Sun; mass, as well as the mass distribution; size; rate of rotation and its direction; shape; temperature; presence or absence of an intrinsic magnetic field; composition of the surface material; structure of the surface; as well as the presence or absence of an atmosphere, along with its composition. In this context, India has already sent three space missions to Moon in its Chandrayaan series in years 2008, 2019 and 2023 respectively, and one mission to the Mars, as the Mars Orbiter Mission, in year 2014. These missions have created significant scientific impact globally, and materialized several international collaborations in planetary science. Venus is the next target in this chain of scientific explorations. Earth’s Moon and Venus in the Context of Comparative Planetology A major commonality between the Earth’s Moon and the planet Venus is that, both reside within what we call the ‘inner solar system’. Despite that, there are significant differences between them. Speaking about the Earth’s Moon, it is located almost at ~1 Astronomical Unit (1 AU, which is called the Sun-Earth distance, ~ 1.49 X 108km) from the Sun, if we ignore the Earth-Moon distance (~ 3.84X105km) in comparison with the Sun-Earth distance. In comparison, Venus is at about 0.72 AU distance from the Sun. A significant difference comes in terms of their atmosphere; Venus has a thick Carbon Dioxide dominated atmosphere, the atmospheric pressure at the Surface of Venus is about 92 bar (for Earth, it is approximately 1 bar). For Earth’s Moon, this value can be anything between 10-13bar (during Lunar day) to 10-15bar (during Lunar night). Thus, the Earth’s Moon has about 10-15to 10-17times lesser number of gas molecules around it, as compared with Venus. Again, the thick Carbon Dioxide dominated atmosphere in Venus has caused a severe greenhouse effect, which is beyond imagination in the case of the Earth’s Moon. It is because of the greenhouse effect, the surface temperature of Venus may be as high as ~ 730 K (K is the Kelvin scale, equivalent value in Centigrade would be ~457 degree C). The surface of the Earth’s Moon may experience temperatures like ~100 K (~ -173 degree C) during lunar night, and ~ 400 K (~ 127 degree C) during lunar day. There are a few Permanently Shadowed Regions (PSR) at the lunar polar zones, which can be as cold as ~ 27 K (~-246 degree C). Coming to the aspect of the intrinsic magnetic field (Earth has one), both Venus and Earth’s Moon lack one. However, as Venus has a thick atmosphere around it, it gives rise to a significant ionosphere. Interaction between the solar wind (mostly ionized Hydrogen and Helium, plus electrons and a small fraction of heavier ions) and the charged particles in the Venusian ionosphere give rise to an induced magnetic field. In the case of the Earth’s Moon, there are localized patches of magnetic fields at several places on its surface, which are called crustal magnetic fields. There are several other differences as well, but the matter we emphasize here is that, studying the Earth’s Moon and Venus would be significant steps in the comparative planetology of the inner solar system. Mission Scenarios in Lunar and Venusian Exploration In the journey of lunar exploration, it is customary to send orbiters (for global studies), as well as landers and rovers (for in-situ studies at a specific location) to study several facets of the Moon. Due to the technological advancement and the current-day feasibility of designing space missions of certain complexity, sample-return from the Moon is also one of the advanced ways of lunar exploration. Returning lunar samples to the Earth enables the scientific community to subject them to several kinds of laboratory testing and analysis, which are not possible otherwise within the limited scope of the onboard resources in a space mission. However, we cannot afford the same luxury with Venus, as bringing a piece of Venusian surface-sample back to Earth by piercing the thick veil of the Venusian atmosphere, its super-rotation, and the sulphuric acid cloud is one of the most difficult dreams with today’s technology. Rather, Venus is better-explored with orbiters, balloons, and to a limited extent, by impactors that would fall through the thick atmosphere and touch the surface of Venus. Thus, in the roadmap of scientific exploration of the Solar system, explorations of the Earth’s Moon and Venus are of paramount importance. In the subsequent sections, we will discuss the specifics of the Venus Orbiter Mission (VOM) and the Chandrayaan-4 mission. Venus Orbiter Mission (VOM) The importance of the recently-approved Venus Orbiter Mission lies in the fact that globally it is going to impact the Venusian science. Despite sending several space missions globally, Venus retains its enigma. Early missions in the 1960s and 1970s by NASA and the Soviet Union revealed Venus's scorching surface temperature and dense atmosphere. These missions provided initial insights into the planet's atmospheric composition, surface features, and magnetic environment. Later missions in the 1970s and 1980s, such as Pioneer Venus and Vega, expanded our understanding of Venus's atmosphere, including its composition, circulation, and interaction with the Sun. These missions also collected data on the planet's surface and its geological history. More recent missions, like Venus Express and Akatsuki, have focused on studying the planet's atmospheric dynamics, climate evolution, and surface features. These missions have provided valuable information on the planet's unique characteristics and its potential for habitability in the past. However, these missions to Venus had limited and narrow spatial coverage either South-polar region or in equatorial belt. Hence it is difficult to build global maps of many phenomena, including winds, waves, and chemical abundances. Venus Orbiter Mission would provide uniform coverage of Venus, thus providing a unique global dataset for future science missions. The Venus Orbiter Mission will explore the planet's atmosphere, surface, and its interaction with the Sun. Key scientific objectives include examining dust in the Venusian atmosphere, mapping its surface topography in high resolution, studying the solar X-ray spectrum near Venus, analyzing Venusian airglow, and investigating sub-surface characteristics. Additionally, the mission will serve as a technology demonstration for ISRO, testing aerobraking and thermal management techniques in the harsh Venusian environment. For the Venus Orbiter mission (VOM), sixteen Indian payloads, two Indian and international collaborative payloads, and one international payload have been recommended by Experts Review Committee under well-defined broad science themes viz., surface/sub-surface, atmosphere, ionosphere and solar wind Interaction with an aim to explicate the outstanding science questions as well as the gap areas which need further investigations. The scientific payloads / experiments have been recommended for the Venus Orbiter Mission, as described below. S-Band Synthetic Aperture Radar for Venus mission (VSAR)The SAR Instrument operates at S Band frequency of 2.5 GHz (12cm) with four different polarisations viz., Circular-Pol, Full-Pol, Single- and Dual-Pol. The major science objectives of SAR Instrument are to search for recent and active volcanism and detection of volcanic hotspots, Characterizing Impact craters and associated parabolic ejecta and impact melts and the global mapping of Venus at a spatial resolution of 20-30m an order of magnitude better than the available Magellan data. The SAR instrument is also proposed to work in radiometer mode to measure the brightness temperature with spatial Resolution of - 10 km/pixel. Thus SAR instrument will measure dielectric constant, surface roughness parameters, brightness Temperature and topography.Venus Surface Emissivity and Atmospheric Mapper (VSEAM)Venus Surface Emissivity and Atmospheric Mapper is a hyper spectral imaging spectrometer operating in the NIR to SWIR spectral range (0.78-1.7 µm) with about 200 bands, selectable by tele-command with spectral resolution of about 10 nm and spatial resolution about 200m@500km.

LIVE’s science objectives are to detect lightning in the Venusian environment and to understand the electrostatic model of Venusian clouds through lightning signal characteristics and estimate the received lightning energy and its rate in the atmosphere of Venus. The instrument will capture the lightning generated voltage signal and flash rate with a sensitivity better than ~100 μV/m.Venus Atmospheric SpectroPolarimeter (VASP)The proposed instrument is a near infrared spectropolarimeter in the wavelength range of 0.9 - 1.7 μm which is sensitive to linear polarization. The major science objectives of the instrument are to investigate the correlation of cloud Top Altitude with clouds microphysical Properties and to study the process of global circulation on Venus. The instrument measures the spectral radiance with a spectral resolution and spatial sampling of ~2-4 nm and ~8 km respectively.Solar occultation photometry for vertical profiling of Aerosols and thin clouds in Venusian atmosphere (SPAV)The measurement of vertical distribution of aerosols and haze layers in the Venusian mesosphere is proposed based on solar occultation technique in which the attenuated solar irradiance is measured along the Line of Sight (LoS) during each sun set and sun rise for all orbits, using a 2-channel photometer (at wavelengths 500 nm and 850 nm). The science objectives of SPAV are to understand the dynamical and physical processes such as transport and diffusion and the influence of the atmospheric thermodynamics in regulating the vertical distribution of aerosols in the mesospheric region.

Based on the observational requirements the science instruments will be operated and science data will be collected, sent back to Earth and will be received at ISRO Deep Space Network (IDSN) for the further analysis and data dissemination.DSN32 station of Indian Deep Space Network (IDSN) will be used for TTC and science data collection from the spacecraft. In addition to the Indian DSN station, network support from external agencies (like NASA) will be required to have maximum possible contact time with the spacecraft. The IDSN antenna used for the VOM is given in Figure.1.Figure 1. ISRO Deep Space Network (IDSN) AntennaThe science data, to be obtained from the instruments onboard the Venus Orbiter Mission will be received, processed and archived at the Indian Space Science Data Center (ISSDC) for dissemination and use by scientific community in India and abroad. The data from Venus orbiter mission instruments will be formatted and archived in PDS4 standard, in such a way that they are easily accessible by Internet through simple interfaces used elsewhere for similar kind of missions.India’s Venus Orbiter Mission is planned to be launched in March 2028.

Aerobraking will be employed for over a period of 6 to 8 months from VOI to achieve the desired low altitude Science Orbit of 200 X600 km with an inclination of around 90º, to carry out proposed science studies for a period of 5 years. This inclined orbit will provide an excellent opportunity for the first time to probe the surface and atmosphere with high unprecedented spatial and temporal resolution and in-situ observation of ionosphere. The on-orbit configuration of VOM is portrayed in Figure 3.Figure 3. On-Orbit configuration of VOMThe Venus Orbiter Mission is scheduled to launch in March 2028 at a cost of approximately 1236 Crore Indian Rupees. This ambitious mission is expected to create significant employment opportunities, foster skill development, and drive technological advancements in India. To ensure broad engagement and collaboration, ISRO has organized national-level discussions involving scientists, academics, and research students from across the country. These discussions have focused on the scientific rationale behind the mission, the potential contributions of national institutions, and the opportunities for research students to participate.Chandrayaan-4 MissionThe Chandrayaan-4 mission will be India’s fourth mission to the Moon. The first two missions, viz. Chandrayaan-1 and 2 have studied the Moon’s surface, sub-surface and exosphere in a global scale, from orbiter platforms. Chandrayaan-3 has been the first-ever successful lunar soft-landing and robotic exploration in the Southern polar region of the Moon. It has conducted in-situ studies of the lunar surface, near-surface plasma, and recorded, for the first time, lunar ground vibrations in the Southern polar regions.The Chandrayaan-4 mission will be a leap-frog progress in India’s lunar endeavour. While in the Candrayaan-3 mission ISRO demonstrated soft-landing in the lunar South Polar region, roving on the lunar surface, hopping of the lander module on the lunar surface, and bringing back the propulsion module from the lunar to the Earth-bound orbit, the Chandrayaan-4 mission will demonstrate taking off from the lunar surface after collecting surface samples, and bringing back the same to the Earth with protection of the collected samples against damage and contamination.So far, the lunar samples returned by the Apollo and Luna missions (from US and Russia, respectively) stood as the only set of materials accessible to the humankind for laboratory analysis. However, those                 lunar samples were returned from zones of similar geological nature.                 Considering the geological diversity of the Moon's surface, the Apollo                 and Luna samples did not cover the totality of the different types of                 the lunar materials. Towards attaining a more complete picture of the                 Earth-Moon system during the origin and formative days of the Moon, it                 is imperative to study different kinds of lunar samples returned from                 diverse geological zones. This requirement, to a certain extent, was                 met by the Chinese Chang'e-5 lunar mission, which returned lunar                 sample from a geologically young zone, thus facilitating the                 understanding of the thermal history of the Moon. This requirement                 continues, and the lunar science community needs more lunar samples,                 to be collected from diverse geological zones.In this context, India’s Chandrayaan-4 mission, planned for lunar sample return from the Southern polar region is of utmost significance. This is more so after India’s systematic exploration of the Moon through orbiter, lander and rover. Lunar surface exploration missions followed by sample return will be the next major step in lunar exploration for India, and will result in important contributions in understanding the Earth-Moon system.Science enabled by returned samples is unique when compared to in-situ instruments and global measurements. Much of the science in Chandrayaan-4 is concentrated on analysing the samples on ground, however the cameras and sensors onboard the spacecraft modules will provide useful insights on the texture of lunar regolith around the landing site and geologic context for interpretation of analysed samples.  Studying the returned samples, which are chemically and mineralogically diverse, involve steps ranging from classifying the samples, cataloguing, sample preparation all the way to sample characterisation.Scientists widely use optical and electron microscopy techniques and various spectroscopic methods over a wide range of electromagnetic spectrum to understand the physical properties and internal structure of the samples. Scanning electron microscopes and electron microprobes enable chemical and mineralogical analysis at nanometer to micrometer scales.  In addition, ion beam instruments and transmission electron microscopes provide detailed understanding of the samples in terms of composition.  Such analysis are extremely useful to understand the origin and evolution of the Moon and Earth, as well as the inner solar system.Moreover, the returned samples will take advantage of all the instrumentation and capabilities available on the Earth, not only at the time of return but also in the future.The spacecraft would comprise five modules - Ascender Module (AM), Descender Module (DM), Re-entry Module (RM), Transfer Module (TM), and Propulsion Module (PM). The five modules are planned to be launched as two stacks; DM + AM in one stack and TM + RM + PM as the second stack, onboard two separate LVM3 launch vehicles. Figures 4 and 5 depict the stacks of the Chandrayaan-4, comprising different modules.Figure 4. Stack-1 in Chandrayaan-4, which comprises the Ascender and Descender ModulesFigure 5. Stack-2 in Chandrayaan-4, which comprises the Transfer, Re-entry and Propulsion ModulesAfter two launches, the stacks will be docked together in elliptical Earth orbit to form an integrated stack. Subsequent to docking, the Integrated Stack will perform first set of Earth-bound maneuvers with PM propulsion system.  Once the PM is depleted, it gets jettisoned from the Integrated stack.  The integrated stack (DM + AM + TM + RM) performs all the maneuvers to achieve the lunar orbit, such that the orbit plane has the pre-determined landing site.  In the final lunar orbit, DM+AM gets separated from TM+ RM.  DM+AM then undergoes powered descent to achieve soft landing on the lunar surface.After touch down, a robotic arm, also called the Surface Sampling Robot mounted on the DM will scoop ~ 2 – 3 kg samples around the landing site and transfer it to a container on the AM.  In addition, a drilling mechanism will collect sub-surface samples and transfer it to another container in the AM. The containers with samples will be sealed to prevent contamination and leakage during its journey to Earth.  Various phases of sample collection operations will be monitored through video cameras.Once sample collection is completed, AM would ascend to the lunar orbit and dock with the parked TM+RM.  Samples will be transferred from AM to RM.  After sample transfer, the TM+RM will be undocked from AM.Later, the TM + RM will perform maneuvers to return to Earth.  At suitable entry corridor, RM would get separated from TM and performs ballistic re-entry into Earth’s atmosphere and finally landing onto Earth landmass along with Lunar Sample.In the Chandrayaan-4 mission, preserving the samples in a pristine and uncontaminated state is of paramount importance.  Sample recovery, contamination and safety protocols, preservation and curation will be worked out in an impeccable manner.The Chandrayaan-4 mission aims to be entirely self-reliant, with all critical technologies developed domestically. Surface sampling, drilling mechanism, sample storage cartridge, sample transfer and docking are some of the new technologies which would be demonstrated in this mission.  Indian industries will play a pivotal role in realizing this mission, which is expected to promote skill development, create significant employment opportunities and drive technological advancements. Chandrayaan-4 will pave the way for India's future manned missions, lunar sample return, and scientific analysis.It will also develop and demonstrate technologies, algorithms and operations for a mission that returns from the Moon back to the Earth, eventually enabling the planning of a mission to land Gaganyatris on the Moon, and bring them back safely.EpilogueTo foster collaboration and knowledge sharing, both the missions will involve Indian academia through workshops and conferences. Additionally, for Chandrayaan-4, the establishment of facilities for sample curation and analysis will serve as valuable national assets.The Venus Orbiter Mission and the Chandrayaan-4 mission will be two major vehicles for India’s journey to the goal of Vikshit Bharat, towards excellence in space science exploration.References:NASA Science.

This requirement                 continues, and the lunar science community needs more lunar samples,                 to be collected from diverse geological zones. In this context, India’s Chandrayaan-4 mission, planned for lunar sample return from the Southern polar region is of utmost significance. This is more so after India’s systematic exploration of the Moon through orbiter, lander and rover. Lunar surface exploration missions followed by sample return will be the next major step in lunar exploration for India, and will result in important contributions in understanding the Earth-Moon system. Science enabled by returned samples is unique when compared to in-situ instruments and global measurements. Much of the science in Chandrayaan-4 is concentrated on analysing the samples on ground, however the cameras and sensors onboard the spacecraft modules will provide useful insights on the texture of lunar regolith around the landing site and geologic context for interpretation of analysed samples.  Studying the returned samples, which are chemically and mineralogically diverse, involve steps ranging from classifying the samples, cataloguing, sample preparation all the way to sample characterisation. Scientists widely use optical and electron microscopy techniques and various spectroscopic methods over a wide range of electromagnetic spectrum to understand the physical properties and internal structure of the samples. Scanning electron microscopes and electron microprobes enable chemical and mineralogical analysis at nanometer to micrometer scales.  In addition, ion beam instruments and transmission electron microscopes provide detailed understanding of the samples in terms of composition.  Such analysis are extremely useful to understand the origin and evolution of the Moon and Earth, as well as the inner solar system. Moreover, the returned samples will take advantage of all the instrumentation and capabilities available on the Earth, not only at the time of return but also in the future. The spacecraft would comprise five modules - Ascender Module (AM), Descender Module (DM), Re-entry Module (RM), Transfer Module (TM), and Propulsion Module (PM). The five modules are planned to be launched as two stacks; DM + AM in one stack and TM + RM + PM as the second stack, onboard two separate LVM3 launch vehicles. Figures 4 and 5 depict the stacks of the Chandrayaan-4, comprising different modules. Figure 4. Stack-1 in Chandrayaan-4, which comprises the Ascender and Descender Modules Figure 5. Stack-2 in Chandrayaan-4, which comprises the Transfer, Re-entry and Propulsion Modules After two launches, the stacks will be docked together in elliptical Earth orbit to form an integrated stack. Subsequent to docking, the Integrated Stack will perform first set of Earth-bound maneuvers with PM propulsion system.  Once the PM is depleted, it gets jettisoned from the Integrated stack.  The integrated stack (DM + AM + TM + RM) performs all the maneuvers to achieve the lunar orbit, such that the orbit plane has the pre-determined landing site.  In the final lunar orbit, DM+AM gets separated from TM+ RM.  DM+AM then undergoes powered descent to achieve soft landing on the lunar surface. After touch down, a robotic arm, also called the Surface Sampling Robot mounted on the DM will scoop ~ 2 – 3 kg samples around the landing site and transfer it to a container on the AM.  In addition, a drilling mechanism will collect sub-surface samples and transfer it to another container in the AM. The containers with samples will be sealed to prevent contamination and leakage during its journey to Earth.  Various phases of sample collection operations will be monitored through video cameras. Once sample collection is completed, AM would ascend to the lunar orbit and dock with the parked TM+RM.  Samples will be transferred from AM to RM.  After sample transfer, the TM+RM will be undocked from AM. Later, the TM + RM will perform maneuvers to return to Earth.  At suitable entry corridor, RM would get separated from TM and performs ballistic re-entry into Earth’s atmosphere and finally landing onto Earth landmass along with Lunar Sample. In the Chandrayaan-4 mission, preserving the samples in a pristine and uncontaminated state is of paramount importance.  Sample recovery, contamination and safety protocols, preservation and curation will be worked out in an impeccable manner. The Chandrayaan-4 mission aims to be entirely self-reliant, with all critical technologies developed domestically. Surface sampling, drilling mechanism, sample storage cartridge, sample transfer and docking are some of the new technologies which would be demonstrated in this mission.  Indian industries will play a pivotal role in realizing this mission, which is expected to promote skill development, create significant employment opportunities and drive technological advancements. Chandrayaan-4 will pave the way for India's future manned missions, lunar sample return, and scientific analysis. It will also develop and demonstrate technologies, algorithms and operations for a mission that returns from the Moon back to the Earth, eventually enabling the planning of a mission to land Gaganyatris on the Moon, and bring them back safely. Epilogue To foster collaboration and knowledge sharing, both the missions will involve Indian academia through workshops and conferences. Additionally, for Chandrayaan-4, the establishment of facilities for sample curation and analysis will serve as valuable national assets. The Venus Orbiter Mission and the Chandrayaan-4 mission will be two major vehicles for India’s journey to the goal of Vikshit Bharat, towards excellence in space science exploration. References:"

"event/Discovery_of_a_buried_crater_on_the_moon!_chandrayaan-3_vikram_lander_and_pragyan_rover_landed_within_it","has_description","September 30, 2024 In a study published in peer-reviewed journal Icarus, scientists from PRL and ISRO have shown that Indian Lunar mission Chandrayaan-3 landed within a buried impact crater, which is around 160 km in size, ~4.4 km deep, and likely to be older than the South Pole Atkin (SPA) basin. This is revealed based on analysis of images obtained by Navigation Cameras on Chandrayaan-3 Pragyan rover and Chandrayaan-2 Orbiter’s Optical High Resolution Camera. The Chandrayaan-3 mission with the Vikram-lander and the Pragyan rover landed in the high latitude highland region near the south pole of the Moon. The landing site is located ~350 km from the South Pole-Aitken basin rim, an ancient and the largest impact basin in the Solar System. This landing site has undergone the complex emplacement sequence of SPA basin ejecta followed by the nearby and distant impact                                         basins and complex crater ejecta materials. We found that the SPA  basin is the major contributor, which deposited nearly ~1400 m of ejecta materials, and 11 other basins deposited ~580 m of ejecta. The other complex craters contributed up to ~90 m of ejecta. Meanwhile, secondary craters of a few km's in diameter located adjacent to the Vikram lander contributed to ~0.5 m ejecta, which are crucial target materials for the Pragyan rover insitu analysis. Figure. 1 (Left) Chandrayaan-2 OHRC image shows the Chandrayaan-3 landing site with linear, parallel grooves-like structure extending from SW to NE side and spread to several 100’ s of meters. These features indicate ejecta from distant impacts was emplaced over the landing site.(Right) The Pragyan rover Navcam images taken from the south of Vikram lander shows the linear groove-like feature present over the landing site.  The other Navcam image shows the Vikram lander and the boulder distributed around the landing site. OHRC id: ch2_ohr_ncp_20200826T0303458884_d_img_d18. The Pragyan rover Navcam and Optical High Resolution Camera images gave the first clue about the linear, distal ejecta rays or groove-like structures possibly formed due to the distant impacts deposited at the Chandrayaan-3 landing site. Figure 1. shows the CH2-OHRC and CH-3 Navcam images of landing site region mantled by linear-groove like structures. Pragyan rover images revealed the landing site is devoid of > 1 m boulders along the traverse, which reveals typical highland terrain. Figure. 2 Black arrow shows the boundary of the semi-circular buried impact crater within which the Chandrayaan-3 mission landed. The SLDEM draped over the hill shade image to highlight the buried semi-circular structure which is the destination of the Chandrayaan-3 mission. The regional exploration around the Chandrayaan-3 landing site revealed a near semi-circular like structure, with highly degraded in nature. This semi-circular structure encompassed the Statio Shiv Shakti (yellow star) as shown in the Figure 2. Further detailed geomorphological and topographical analysis revealed that the semi-circular structure is a heavily degraded crater structure or a buried impact crater with a diameter of ~160 km. This semi-circular structure was highly degraded due to the mantling of thick ejecta deposits from the SPA basin and followed by many other complex craters throughout the geological history of the Moon. This buried crater is one of the oldest crater on the Moon, and the Chandrayaan-3 Vikram lander and Pragyan rover landed and roved within this buried crater, which is hosting the SPA basin ejecta material and some of the most deeply excavated materials on the Moon. The regional exploration around the Chandrayaan-3 landing site The research work is published journal Icarushttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.icarus.2024.116329with the title “Chandrayaan-3 landing site evolution by South Pole-Aitken basin and other impact craters”, authored by  S Vijayan, KB Kimi, Anil Chavan, R Aditi, U Thahira, V Rama Subramanian, Rishitosh K Sinha, Santosh Vadawale, M Shanmugam, NPS Mithun, Arpit R Patel, S Amit Basu, KV Iyer, K Suresh, Ajay Prashar, G Rima, Anil Bhardwaj."

"event/EOIR_Payload_on_EOS-08_Begins_Operations,_Offering_excellent_Thermal_Imaging_Capabilities","has_description","September 19, 2024 The Electro Optical-Infrared (EOIR) payload on board EOS-08, ISRO’s latest Earth Observation Satellite, launched through the third developmental flight of ISRO's Small Satellite Launch Vehicle (SSLV) on August 16, 2024, has commenced its operations (EOS-08 Mission). EOIR is a state-of-the-art payload aboard EOS-08, along with the Global Navigation Satellite System-Reflectometry (GNSS-R) payload and the SiC UV Dosimeter. Developed by the Space Applications Centre (SAC-ISRO), the EOIR payload is equipped with advanced mid-wave infrared (MIR) and long-wave infrared (LWIR) channels, marking a significant advancement in thermal imaging technology with its high performance. One of the first images captured by the EOIR payload was taken on August 19, 2024, over Pune city at 07:45 AM local time, as shown in Figure 1. The MIR image highlights the payload’s ability to capture high-resolution thermal images. Figure 1: EOIR Image Over Pune City Images were taken over the Namibia Desert on August 21, 2024, at 11:15 AM local time. The LWIR image, shown in Figure 2, further highlights the payload’s ability to capture high-resolution thermal images with an exceptional level of detail. The ongoing commissioning phase has included initial calibration over a sea target, and early results indicate that the EOIR payload’s performance for both MIR and LWIR channels meets the expected standards. Further validation is underway to ensure consistent accuracy across various environmental conditions. Figure 2: EOIR Image Over Namibia Desert This high-resolution infrared camera provides thermal images with an unprecedented level of detail (Figure 3), offering unique capabilities that enhance a variety of applications. Figure 3:EOIR Image Over Namibia Desert In addition to the desert imagery, Figure 4 displays land surface temperature (LST) data derived from the EOIR payload over Santiago, Chile, compared with data from Landsat-09's Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS). The Landsat-09 data, acquired on August 24, 2024, at 10:33 AM local time, is compared with EOS-08's data from 2:45 PM local time. The difference in time between these images resulted in a temperature increase of about 2.5 K, as expected due to diurnal temperature variations. The EOIR payload's superior resolution at 8 meters spatial accuracy allows for detailed temperature mapping, demonstrating its potential in capturing fine thermal variations. Figure 4:Land Surface Temperature from Landsat-09 TIRS and EOS-08 EOIR The ongoing commissioning process will further validate the EOIR payload's capabilities, ultimately enhancing its role in environmental monitoring. This includes precise applications such as improved agricultural management, more effective wildfire detection, and accurate urban heat island (UHI) mapping. The payload's high-resolution thermal data promises to deliver actionable insights that help address pressing environmental and climate challenges. The EOIR payload’s LWIR channel has been particularly effective in agricultural monitoring. By providing detailed data on soil moisture and vegetation health, the EOIR payload enables optimized water use, improved crop yields, and more efficient farm management. Its ability to differentiate between fire-affected areas and surrounding landscapes makes it a powerful tool in wildfire management as well. The MIR channel has shown impressive capability in detecting heat emissions from active fires, offering critical insights for early detection and continuous monitoring of wildfires. This is crucial for assessing fire intensity and behaviour, which supports more effective response efforts to mitigate damage. In urban planning, the EOIR payload’s thermal imagery has been instrumental in mapping Urban Heat Islands (UHI). The ability to capture detailed temperature variations within urban environments enhances efforts to design sustainable cities that mitigate heat-related challenges. Data from the EOIR payload, processed using algorithms and software developed by SAC-ISRO at the National Remote Sensing Centre (NRSC-ISRO), is being transformed into actionable insights. These insights are expected to support a wide range of applications, from optimizing agricultural practices to better managing wildfires and addressing urban heat challenges."

"event/GNSS-Reflectometry:_A_Novel_Remote_Sensing_Initiated_by_EOS-08","has_description","August 28,2024 The GNSS-Reflectometry (GNSS-R) instrument on the EOS-08 satellite commenced operations on August 18, 2024. The raw data is being processed at the National Remote Sensing Centre (NRSC-ISRO) in Shadnagar, Hyderabad, using algorithms and data processing software developed by the Space Applications Centre (SAC-ISRO), Ahmedabad. Multiple levels of data products have been successfully generated. GNSS-Reflectometry represents a new mode of remote sensing. Signals from Global and Regional Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS/RNSS), such as GPS and NavIC, are reflected off various Earth surfaces, including oceans, agricultural lands, and river bodies. These reflected signals are collected by a precision receiver onboard the satellite (Fig. 1) as it orbits the Earth at an altitude of 475 km. This measurement system operates without dedicated transmitters and is shallow in resource consumption—requiring minimal size, weight, and power. Additionally, it can scale up as a constellation of receivers for faster coverage, making this innovative remote-sensing mode highly useful. Fig.1: General principle of GNSS-Reflectometry Fig.2 Delay Doppler Maps of Reflections The GNSS-R instrument, developed by the Space Applications Centre (SAC-ISRO), is India’s first space-borne precision receiver. It collects ground-reflected GNSS signals and measures their power and other signal characteristics. These measurements are used to derive scientific information about the regions covered by the receiver, including soil moisture, surface inundation, and ocean surface wind and wave measurements. The instrument provides a resolution of 15 km x 15 km over oceans and better than 1 km x 1 km over land. Delay-Doppler Maps (DDMs) are the primary outputs from GNSS-R raw data processing (Fig 2). These DDMs are used to derive parameters such as reflectivity and Normalized Bistatic Radar Cross-Section (NBRCS), which are then used for the retrieval of various scientific parameters. All the science products are generated at SAC-ISRO using in-house developed algorithms. The first land data was collected over the Sahara Desert (North Africa) using a high-resolution mode of 1 km, which is significantly better than that of contemporary CYGNSS sensors. This data was processed to retrieve soil moisture (Fig. 3) at high resolution, and the results were found to be within the expected range. Another high-resolution land dataset was acquired over the Amazon Rainforest on August 21. This data has been used to generate surface inundation masks along the specular reflection track, showing sensitivity even towards sub-kilometer river widths (Fig. 3). The first ocean data was collected on August 19, over a region of the Pacific Ocean. This data was processed for the retrieval of wind speed and significant wave height (Fig. 4), with all obtained values falling within the expected ranges.

"event/EOS-08_Mission_Overview","has_description","August 6, 2024 EOS-08 is ISRO’s latest Earth Observation Satellite, slated for launch by the Small Satellite Launch Vehicle (SSLV)-D3. The primary objectives of the EOS-08 mission include designing and developing a microsatellite, creating payload instruments compatible with the microsatellite bus, and incorporating new technologies required for future operational satellites. Built on the Microsat/IMS-1 bus, EOS-08 carries three payloads: Electro Optical Infrared Payload (EOIR), Global Navigation Satellite System-Reflectometry payload (GNSS-R), and SiC UV Dosimeter. The EOIR payload is designed to capture images in the Mid-Wave IR (MIR) and Long-Wave IR (LWIR) bands, both during the day and night, for applications such as satellite-based surveillance, disaster monitoring, environmental monitoring, fire detection, volcanic activity observation, and industrial and power plant disaster monitoring. The GNSS-R payload demonstrates the capability of using GNSS-R-based remote sensing for applications such as ocean surface wind analysis, soil moisture assessment, cryosphere studies over the Himalayan region, flood detection, and inland waterbody detection. Meanwhile, the SiC UV Dosimeter monitors UV irradiance at the viewport of the Crew Module in the Gaganyaan Mission and serves as a high-dose alarm sensor for gamma radiation. The spacecraft mission configuration is set to operate in a Circular Low Earth Orbit (LEO) at an altitude of 475 km with an inclination of 37.4°, and has a mission life of 1 year. The satellite has a mass of approximately 175.5 kg and generates power of around 420 W. It interfaces with the SSLV-D3/IBL-358 launch vehicle. EOS-08 marks a significant advancement in satellite mainframe systems such as an Integrated Avionics system, known as the Communication, Baseband, Storage, and Positioning (CBSP) Package, which combines multiple functions into a single, efficient unit. This system is designed with cold redundant systems using commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) components and evaluation boards, supporting up to 400 Gb of data storage. Additionally, the satellite includes a structural panel embedded with PCB, an embedded battery, a Micro-DGA (Dual Gimbal Antenna), an M-PAA (Phased Array Antenna), and a flexible solar panel, each serving as key components for onboard technology demonstration. The satellite employs a miniaturized design in its Antenna Pointing Mechanisms, capable of achieving a rotational speed of 6 degrees per second and maintaining a pointing accuracy of ±1 degree. The miniaturized phased array antenna further enhances communication capabilities, while the flexible solar panel incorporates a foldable solar panel substrate, GFRP tube, and CFRP honeycomb rigid end panel, offering improved power generation and structural integrity. A pyrolytic graphite sheet diffuser plate, known for its high thermal conductivity of 350 W/mK, reduces mass and finds application in various satellite functions. Furthermore, the EOS-08 mission adopts a new method of integrating housekeeping panels using a hinge-based fixture, significantly reducing the duration of the Assembly, Integration, and Testing (AIT) phase. Incorporating additional novel schemes, the EOS-08 mission improves satellite technology through X-band data transmission, utilizing pulse shaping and Frequency Compensated Modulation (FCM) for X-Band data transmitters. The satellite’s battery management system employs SSTCR-based charging and bus regulation, sequentially including or excluding strings at a frequency of 6 Hz. The TM-TC system supports dual modes, including CDMA and Direct PSK, with miniaturized microstrip filters tailored for data and TM-TC applications. The mission's indigenization effort is evident in its solar cell fabrication processes and the use of a Nano-Star Sensor for Microsat Applications. Additionally, the inertial system benefits from reaction wheel isolators that attenuate vibrations and a single antenna interface is utilized for TTC and SPS applications. Thermal management is enhanced using materials such as AFE BGA, Kintex FPGA, Germanium Black Kapton, and STAMET (Si-Al Alloy) Black Kapton to handle the thermal properties of COTS components. The mission also incorporates an auto-launch pad initialization feature, further demonstrating its commitment to innovative mission management. EOS-08 satellite"

"event/Aditya-L1_Mission:_Completion_of_First_Halo_Orbit","has_description","July 2, 2024 Today, Aditya-L1 spacecraft has completed its first halo orbit around the Sun-Earth L1 point. The Aditya-L1 mission is an Indian solar observatory at Lagrangian point L1, launched on September 2, 2023 and was inserted in its targeted halo orbit on January 6, 2024. Aditya-L1 spacecraft in the Halo orbit takes 178 days to complete a revolution around the L1 point. During its travel in the halo orbit, Aditya-L1 spacecraft will be subjected to various perturbing forces that will cause it to depart from the targeted orbit. It underwent two station-keeping maneuvers on  February 22 and June 7, respectively, to maintain this orbit. Today's 3rd station-keeping maneuver has ensured that its travel continued in to thesecond halo orbit path around L1. This journey of Aditya L1 around Sun-Earth L1 Lagrangian point involves modeling of complex dynamics. The understanding of various perturbing forces acting on the spacecraft helped in determining the trajectory accurately and planning precise orbit maneuvers. With today's maneuver, the state-of-the-art flight dynamics software developed in-house at URSC-ISRO for the Aditya-L1 missions stands fully validated. The blue trajectory, in the figure, is the orbit around the Lagrangian point L1. This trajectory is a 3 dimensional trajectory, and what is shown is the projection of it in the X-Y plane. SK#1, 2 & 3 are the Station Keeping maneuvers by the Aditya-L1 spacecraft. The final firing of the thrusters, ie. SK#3 on  July 2, placed the spacecraft back in the required orbit. If an accurate firing was not done, the spacecraft would have moved away in a trajectory shown in green colour. The X-Y axes are marked in distance of km, with Lagrangian point L1 at the origin."

"event/Aditya-L1’s_SUIT_and_VELC_Capture_Solar_Fury","has_description","June 10, 2024 The Active region AR13664 on the Sun, during its passage during the week of May 8 – 15, 2024, erupted several X-class and M-class flares, which were associated with Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) during May 8 and 9. These produced a major geomagnetic storm on May 11, 2024. Two of the remote sensing payloads on board Aditya-L1 (SoLEXS and HEL1OS) captured these events during May 8-9, 2024 while the two in-situ payloads (ASPEX and MAG) captured this event during May 10-11, 2024 during its passage through L1. These observations were subsequently reported by ISRO, along with the observations made by the Chandrayaan-2 spacecraft, XPoSat as well as by USO-PRL ground-based facility. During those series of eruptive events, two remote sensing instruments onboard Aditya-L1, viz. the Solar Ultra Violet Imaging Telescope (SUIT) and the Visible Emission Line Coronagraph (VELC) were in baking and calibration modes respectively, and couldn’t observe the event during May 10- 11. Both SUIT and VELC doors were opened on May 14 after the completion of the indented operations. Observations by these payloads (SUIT & VELC) are provided below: SUIT observations The Sun images acquired by the SUIT payload on May 17, 2024, are provided below. Figure 1: Sun image in Mg II k line (NB3):NB3 shows the bright, active regions on the Solar disk. The active regions signify magnetically active regions on the Sun’s surface. Large solar flares may originate in these active regions due to changes in magnetic field. The Sun is moving towards solar maximum, giving rise to enhanced activity. So, there are several active regions visible around the equatorial region. Figure 2: Sun image in Mg II h line (NB4):Similar to NB3, NB4 shows the bright active regions on the Solar disk. The active regions signify magnetically active regions on the Sun’s surface. Solar flares may originate in these active regions due to changes in magnetic fields. The Sun is moving towards solar maximum, giving rise to enhanced activity. So, there are several active regions visible around the equatorial region. Figure 3: Sun image in Narrow Band 276 nm (NB2):The continuum emission shows the sunspots in the active regions. The plages around the active regions are also visible. Figure 4: Sun image in Narrow Band 283 nm (NB5):The continuum emission shows the sunspots in the active regions. The plages around the active regions are also visible. The relative brightness of the sunspots are different from 276 nm narrow band. This variation appears as the different narrow bands probe different heights of the atmosphere, probing the structural difference of the magnetic tubes at different heights. Figure 5: Sun image in Narrow Band 300 nm (NB6):The continuum emission shows the sunspots in the active regions. The plage region around the sunspots is also visible. The sunspots show umbra (dark sunspots) and penumbra (less dark region around the sunspot). Figure 6: Sun image in Broad Band 320-360 nm (BB3):320-360 nm broadband probes the UV continuum emission from the chromosphere, sampling a wide range of depth in the solar atmosphere. The sunspots on the disk and the limb are prominently visible. A comparison of solar images taken by SUIT payload at different wavelength VELC Observations VELC also carried out observations in one of the spectroscopic channels for the emission line 5303 Angstrom. Raster scans of the solar corona were carried out on May 14, 2024, to capture the coronal activities in this particular spectral line. The raster scan image at this wavelength is shown in Figure 7. AR 13664 location is marked in this raster image as a box. The raster image is created by assembling the wavelength-averaged slit images as the Sun is rastered on the slit of the spectrograph. The duration of the raster is about 20 minutes and used four slits covering different regions of the solar corona simultaneously. The yellow ‘open’ circle in the image indicates the edge of the solar photosphere (i.e. the ‘visible’ disk of the Sun). The black ‘filled’ circle indicates the extent of the occulting disk used in the VELC to block the bright light of the solar photosphere so that the relatively million times faint structures in the solar corona could be observed.

"event/TRISHNA_Mission:_Advancing_High-Resolution_Thermal_Imaging_for_Climate_and_Resource_Management","has_description","June 5, 2024 The TRISHNA (Thermal Infra-RedImagingSatellite forHigh-resolutionNatural ResourceAssessment) mission, a collaborative endeavor between ISRO and CNES, is engineered to deliver high spatial and high temporal resolution monitoring of Earth's surface temperature, emissivity, biophysical and radiation variables for surface energy budgeting at regional to global scale. This mission addresses critical water and food security challenges, focusing on the impacts of human-induced climate change and efficient water resource management through evapotranspiration monitoring. TRISHNA's primary objectives include detailed monitoring of the energy and water budgets of the continental biosphere for quantifying terrestrial water stress and water use and high-resolution observation of water quality and dynamics in coastal and inland waters. In addition, as secondary objectives, the TRISHNA mission will also help in a comprehensive assessment of urban heat islands, detection of thermal anomalies linked to volcanic activity and geothermal resources, and precise monitoring of snow-melt runoff and glacier dynamics. The mission will also provide valuable data on aerosol optical depth, atmospheric water vapor, and cloud cover. The scientific and societal benefits of TRISHNA are extensive. In agricultural water management, TRISHNA science data products will help to assess irrigation water use, issue advisories for water savings and enhance crop water productivity through efficient and sustainable water management practices, and better micro-watershed management. For climate monitoring, the mission will track key indicators such as droughts, permafrost changes, and evapotranspiration rates. Urban planners will benefit from detailed urban heat island maps and heat alerts; while water quality monitoring will aid in detecting pollution in coastal and inland water bodies. It will also help in identifying sub-marine groundwater discharge at the coastal fringes. Additionally, TRISHNA will support the detection of sub-surface fires and assessment of geothermal resources; while cryosphere monitoring will evaluate snow cover and snow-melt patterns, contributing to improved hydrological models. TRISHNA satellite is equipped with two primary payloads. The Thermal Infra-Red (TIR) payload, provided by CNES, features a four-channel long-wave infrared imaging sensor capable of high-resolution surface temperature and emissivity mapping. The Visible - Near Infra-Red - Short Wave Infra-Red (VNIR-SWIR) payload, developed by ISRO, includes seven spectral bands designed for detailed mapping of surface reflectance of VSWIR bands for generating important biophysical and radiation budget variables. The variables retrieved from the combination of payload data would help in solving surface energy balance to estimate surface heat fluxes. The satellite will operate in a sun-synchronous orbit at an altitude of 761 km, with a local time of 12:30 PM at the equator. This orbit will provide a spatial resolution of 57 meters for land and coastal areas and 1 km for oceanic and polar regions. The mission is designed for a 5-year operational life. TRISHNA’s data will contribute to several global initiatives, such as GEOGLAM for agricultural monitoring, the UN's Sustainable Development Goals and targets, and the Global Water Watch. Some of the mission’s outputs will serve as Essential Agricultural Variables (EAVs), and Essential Climate Variables (ECVs) for the global community. TRISHNA mission is expected to signify a substantial advancement in remote sensing technology, addressing critical water and food security issues and providing essential data to help bring out sustainable solutions for policy/decision makers, watershed managers, agro-industries and farming community over inland and coastland. With its high-resolution high-repeat imaging capabilities, it would enhance our understanding of Earth's natural processes and support global efforts in climate change mitigation through optimized resource management.

Additionally, SHAR supplied historical wind data for flight planning and real-time atmospheric data for launch commit criteria, alongside crucial logistics support for system realization and launch campaigns. VSSC/ISRO provided its expertise and facilitated 15-second hot testing of the semi-cryogenic engine. They conducted acoustic tests for the launch vehicle's inter-tank structure at CSIR-NAL's state-of-the-art acoustic testing facility. The mission design underwent thorough verification and validation by VSSC. VSSC provided a comprehensive end-to-end Flight Termination System, including pyro charges, batteries, telecommand decoders, and tracking transponders, ensuring the mission's range safety. It extended on-site support for assembly, integration, wiring, and last-minute pyro operations during the launch campaign, pre-countdown, and countdown phases. ISTRAC/ISRO provided telemetry and tracking support for this launch, through a Memorandum of Understanding with the start-up. Detailed discussions between the teams led to the finalization of critical systems, including the onboard telemetry system configuration and the tracking ground station network. ISTRAC supported the launch campaign from its two ground stations at Shriharikota, offering integration, testing, and real-time tracking. They developed and deployed Vehicle Data Acquisition software to filter real-time data flow to the control center and display systems. On the day of launch, ISTRAC's ground station network provided real-time support, confirming the successful launch. ISRO's extensive and multifaceted support for such missions undertaken by Indian start-ups underscores the collaborative framework made available to startups in the Indian space sector. ISRO assures its support, invites and encourages non-governmental entities to engage themselves in the space sector, paving the way for a vibrant space ecosystem in the country. 15 s duration Hot-test of Agnilet semi-cryogenic engine at VSSC Trajectory verification and validation End-to-end Flight Termination System supplied by VSSC"

"event/High_Energy_X-ray_Modulation_Discovered_in_Swift_J1727.8-1613_Black_Hole_with_AstroSat","has_description","May 20, 2024 In a recent study, AstroSat has enabled the discovery of the ‘aperiodic modulation’ of high-energy X-ray photons during an 'unusual' outburst phase of the black hole binary source Swift J1727.8-1613. This significant discovery, carried out utilizing the unique capabilities of AstroSat, is reported by a team of astrophysicists led by U R Rao Satellite Centre (URSC)/ISRO in collaboration with the Indian Institute of Technology Guwahati (IITG), University of Mumbai, and Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR) in the international journal Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society (MNRAS). In an astrophysical black hole X-ray binary (BH-XRB) system, both the black hole and its companion are locked in a gravitational embrace. A black hole pulls matter from its tidally deformed companion, leading to the formation of a luminous accretion disk. As matter accretes through the disk, it becomes extremely hot, reaching temperatures in the millions of degrees and emitting high-energy X-rays. These electromagnetic radiations act as cosmic messengers, indirectly detecting the black holes shrouded in darkness. In a way, BH-XRBs serve as cosmic laboratories, offering insights into the intricate processes governing accretion dynamics around compact objects and providing invaluable opportunities to study fundamental physical mechanisms in extreme environments. Swift J1727.8-1613 is a black hole X-ray transient (BH-XRT) recently discovered by Swift/BAT on August 24, 2023. Immediate monitoring by MAXI/GSC identified the source as one of the brightest, with an X-ray peak value of approximately 7 Crab (Crab is a standard candle and 1 Crab = 3.8 photons per sq.cm. per s). AstroSat first observed this source on September 2, 2023 (MJD 60189), followed by subsequent observations spanning from September 8, 2023 (MJD 60195) to September 14, 2023 (MJD 60201), with a total exposure time of approximately 207 ks. This study reveals that the ‘aperiodic modulation’ of high-energy X-ray photons resulted in Quasi-periodic Oscillation (QPO) at a fixed frequency in power-frequency space. Remarkably, over a mere 7 days, the QPO frequency of high-energy photons (∼100 kilo-electron Volt, equivalently 1 billion Kelvin) evolved from 1.4 Hz to 2.6 Hz, a unique phenomenon detected for the first time in a BH-XRB. Moreover, this study emphasizes that high-energy X-rays (hard X-rays) are generated from the reprocessing of the low-energy photons (soft X-rays) from the ‘standard’ accretion disk by the ‘hot’ electrons from the inner disk via the Compton scattering process. During AstroSat observations, Swift J1727.8-1613 was in an accretion state dominated by Comptonized emission (~90%) over thermal disk emission (~10%). These findings ascertain that Comptonized X-ray photons exhibit ‘aperiodic modulation’ resulting in the QPO features. QPOs are indispensable for investigating accreting black hole systems. By examining the periodic variations of X-ray photons, QPOs decode the footprints of a black hole’s strong gravity, aiding in understanding their fundamental properties and accretion dynamics. In this work, the team utilized the unique capabilities (high time resolution ~10 µs and large photon collecting area) of the Large Area X-ray Proportional Counter (LAXPC) onboard AstroSat, enabling the variability study of QPO at higher energies. The team also used observational data from the NICER instrument onboard the International Space Station (ISS) to understand the spectral energy distribution of the source.

Soft X-rays originating from the 'standard' accretion disk (Keplerian flow) are inverse-Comptonized by 'hot' electrons of the corona, and high-energy X-rays are produced.

"event/ISRO_Captures_the_Signatures_of_the_Recent_Solar_Eruptive_Events_from_Earth,_Sun-Earth_L1_Point,_and_the_Moon_-_2","has_description","May 17, 2024 A powerful solar storm impacted Earth in early May 2024, triggered by the highly active region AR13664. This region unleashed a series of X-class flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs) directed at Earth. The resulting geomagnetic storm was the most intense since 2003 (Dst index -412 nT), causing disruptions to communication and GPS systems. There have been many M-class and C-class flares as well.  Many of these flares were accompanied with halo CMEs (CMEs that are the one which are directed towards Earth) with high energy particles which are behind the geomagnetic storms observed on early hours of 11 May 2024. Geomagnetic storm index (Kp) touched 9 (which is maximum) and Very strong X-class flare (X 5.8) was recorded. Solar flares are bursts of energy triggered by magnetic reconnection, classified by letter (B-X) with each letter signifying a tenfold increase in power. X-class flares are the most powerful (peak flux range > 10−4 Wm-2), which can trigger major disruptions. The next lower level of flares, the M class, represents the peak flux range of 10−5 – 10−4 Wm-2.This is the biggest Geomagnetic storm since 2003 in terms of its strength, as the flaring region on the Sun was as big as the historically important Carrington event that took place in 1859. Multiple X-class flares and CMEs have hit the earth in the past few days. This had severe effects over high latitudes where trans-polar flights are already being reported to get diverted. More events are expected in the next few days.Indian sector got less affected as the main hit of the storm happened in the early morning of 11th May, when ionosphere has not developed fully. Also, being at lower latitudes, widespread outages haven't been reported in India. Ionosphere was very turbulent over the Pacific and American sectors. Observations from Ground The Udaipur Solar Observatory (USO), located on an island in Fatehsagar Lake in Udaipur, Rajasthan, India, is one of the premier solar observing facilities in India. The island location provides a unique advantage by minimizing air turbulence, which allows for clearer and more stable observations of the Sun. Managed by the Physical Research Laboratory (PRL) in Ahmedabad, an autonomous center under the Department of Space (DOS), USO is renowned for its contributions to solar physics. The observatory is equipped with advanced telescopes and instruments, enabling detailed studies of solar phenomena such as sunspots, solar flares, and the solar magnetic field. These studies are crucial for understanding space weather and its impact on Earth. USO has been actively monitoring recent solar activities subjected to weather conditions in Udaipur (Solar observations from ground telescopes are affected by cloud coverage, rain etc). Figure 1 presents the G-band image of the Sun showing active region AR13664 as observed by USO on May 10. Figure 1: A G-band image of the Sun taken on May 10, 2024, from the Udaipur Solar Observatory (USO) shows the active region AR13664, which is responsible for several M and X-class solar flares and has generated most severe solar storms since 2003. The G-band refers to a specific region of the solar spectrum around 430.5 nanometers  in the blue part of the visible spectrum. Observations in the G-band are often used in solar physics to study the fine structure of the Sun’s photosphere, particularly magnetic fields and sunspots, due to the high contrast this wavelength provides for such locations. The main punch of this event so far arrived in the early morning hours of 11 May in India, when Ionosphere was not fully developed. The GNSS network observations at the National Atmospheric Research Laboratory (NARL, at Gadanki, Andhra Pradesh- with coordinates 13.4593° N, 79.1684° E) show decrease of the Total Electron Content (TEC) by more than 50% from 10 May midnight to 11 May morning. On 11 May daytime TEC was high by about 10% with large variations indicating disturbed ionosphere. In the evening TEC is nearly 30% more. No L band scintillation has been observed. Radar observations showed no bubble, consistent with TEC and scintillation observed by GNSS receivers. While this was the observation from Gadanki, the observations by the Thumba (coordinates 8.5310° N, 76.8750° E) node of the INSWIM (Indian Network for Space Weather Impact Monitoring) network was more dramatic. This is expected, as the ionospheric ring current, which is enhanced during geomagnetic storms, passes over the sky of Thumba. In response to the geomagnetic storm on May 11, 2024 a sharp enhancement in the TEC values was observed at Trivandrum post 8 UT and by 10 UT, it led to over 100 % increase compared to the control day on 09/10 May. About 80 TECu (1 Total Electron Content unit of TECu means 1016 electrons per meter square in a column integrated sense) plasma at 09 AM IST over Trivandrum. It's huge in comparison with the typical value of TEC at the same local time, which is ~10-20 TECu. Observations from Space: From Lagrange point L1, from Lunar orbit and from Earth orbit ISRO has mobilised all its observation platforms and systems to record the signatures of this event. Aditya-L1, Chandrayaan-2 and XPoSat have made observations and observed signatures have been analysed. Observations by Aditya-L1 from Earth-Sun Lagrange Point-L1 Meanwhile, the ASPEX payload on-board Aditya -L1 is showing high speed solar wind, high temperature solar wind plasma and energetic ion flux till now. ASPEX comprises two subsystem instruments – the Solar wind Ion Spectrometer (SWIS) and STEPS (SupraThermal and Energetic Particle Spectrometer). The THA-1 (Top Hat Analyser-1) of SWIS works in species differentiated mode and measures the He++ (alpha particles) and H+ ions (protons) separately in 2π radians in the ecliptic plane, while THA-2 (Top Hat Analyser-2) of SWIS works in the species integrated mode in 2π radians across the ecliptic plane. Figure 2 shows the energy histogram for the SWIS sensor in ASPEX., which captures the signature of the solar wind.SWIS has captured the enhancement of the alpha particle and proton flux of the solar wind as a signature of this solar eruptive event. Figure 2: Proton (lower) and alpha (upper) lines are seen from the THA-1 and 2 SWIS observations. The prominent change in the flux is noticed as the signature of this solar eruptive event. The upper and lower panels represent the observations from THA-1 and THA-2 of the SWIS. The colour bar represents the raw counts, in log scale. Figure 3 presents the observations from STEPS. This measures the flux of the solar wind ions at seven energy ranges.A steady rise in the energetic ion fluxes during the event has been noticed. Figure 3: Rise in the ion flux as observed by the STEPS. Each of the curve corresponds to specific energy bands. The X-ray payloads on-board Aditya-L1 (SoLEXS and HEL1OS) have observed the multiple X- and M-class flares from these regions during the last few days while the in-situ magnetometer (MAG) payload has also observed the events as it passed by the L1 point.The observations made by SoLEXS, HEL1OS and MAG payloads are presented in Figures 4, 5 and 6 respectively. Figure 4: LIghtcurve from SoLEXS. It has captured the signatures of the X-class flares in the soft X-Ray regime Figure 5: Lightcure from HEL1OS. It has also captured X class of flares, in the hard X-Ray regime. Figure 6: The measurements with the MAG payload has captured the perturbations in the Interplanetary Magnetic Field (IMF) caused by the solar eruptions. Observations by Chandrayaan-2 from orbit around Moon While the Aditya-L1 observes the Sun from the first Sun-Earth Lagrange point, the Chandrayaan-2 orbiter has also captured the signatures of these solar eruptive events from the lunar polar orbit. XSM has observed many interesting phenomena associated with this geomagnetic storm. Figure 6 shows the solar X-ray flux in the 1 – 8 A range (the same range used by NOAA GOES). The large solar flares (> M5 class), manifested as spikes, are autonomously identified by the onboard logic of XSM, when the internal mechanism was activated to reduce the incident X-ray flux by bringing a filter in front of the detector, so as to prevent its saturation. While the XSM primarily monitors solar X-rays, it has also provided information about the local high energy particle environment by means of counting the events when the upper level discriminator (ULD) threshold is crossed.The ULD event light curve over the past five days, shown in Figure 7, clearly shows the enhancement of the local charge particle concentration from 9th May onwards. The dips observed in the XSM ULD light curve are due to the shadow effect arising from orbit of the spacecraft around the Moon. Figure 6: Chandrayaan-2 XSM light curve of 1-8 angstrom X-ray flux.   The gaps in the light curve are due to the Sun going out of the XSM field of view as the Chandrayaan-2 spacecraft orbits around the Moon. For more details about the observational aspects of XSM, please check the XSM website at https://www.prl.res.in/ch2xsm/ Figure 7 : Variability of high-energy particles in the lunar orbit from ULD events observed by Chandrayaan-2 XSM In addition to XSM, the Chandrayaan-2 Large Area Soft X-ray Spectrometer (CLASS) onboard Chandrayaan-2 has also detected signs of high solar activity. CLASS is primarily designed to measure lunar X-ray fluorescence (XRF) spectra for elemental mapping of the Moon. However, its detectors have also been able to sense particles, as demonstrated by observations of the geotail and solar energetic particle events since it began operating in September 2019. Figure 8 shows a spectrogram from May 11, 2024, where the lunar XRF appears as bright red horizontal lines, and high particle signatures can also be seen. In the figure, the energies below 7 keV represent XRF from the Moon, while the higher energies indicate particles in lunar orbit caused by strong solar activity. Figure 9 shows an increase in particles around May 11-12 in lunar orbit Figure 8: CLASS spectrogram showing lunar X-rays as well as signal due to particles arriving at the Moon related to the high solar activity Figure 9: The Signal in CLASS in the 7-16 keV energy band arises from particles. The increased rates due to the high solar activity can be seen in the light curve Observations by XPoSat from low Earth orbit. None of the Earth Observation Satellites of ISRO which were visible from ISRO’s ground stations had any upsets or latch-ups. The X-ray Polarimeter Satellite (XPoSat) in a low inclination (~6 degrees) 650 km orbit has also detected signs of high solar activity. XSPECT is an X-ray SPECtroscopy and Timing payload onboard XPoSat, which can provide fast timing and good spectroscopic resolution in soft X-rays. XSPECT observes scattered solar X-rays from Earth’s atmosphere (Figure 10), as well as X-ray fluorescence from Argon, which makes up about 0.9% of the atmosphere. Figure 11 shows the signature of particles in XSPECT where an increase in particle flux can be seen during intense solar activities. Figure 10 Solar X-rays scattered off Earth’s atmosphere is observed by XSPECT on board XPoSat during the dayside of its orbit. The signal also includes X-ray fluorescence photons from Argon. In the inset is the corresponding SoLEXS/Aditya-L1 light curve showing the solar flares. Figure 11 Increase in particle flux observed in XSPECT due to intense solar activities. On the Spacecraft Health The Master Control Facility (MCF) team in ISRO was on alert and watchful of any Geomagnetic activity experienced by geo spacecrafts. With respect to disturbances on spacecrafts, the magnetic torquer duty cycle changes due to increased accumulation of disturbances resulting in frequent momentum dumps. Momentum Wheel speed deviations were observed along with MTC current saturation in few spacecrafts. Spacecrafts with one-sided panel had predominant signature variations which required frequent momentum dumping. Otherwise, overall operations were normal. No single event upsets were seen. Star Sensor (SS-2) in INSAT-3DS and Star Sensor (SS-3) in INSAT-3DR were turned off as per Mission. Other than this there has not been any major upsets or anomaly observed in any of the 30 GEO spacecrafts so far. None of the Earth Observation Satellites of ISRO which were visible from ISRO’s ground stations had any upsets or latch-ups. During solar events like this, the energy released from the Sun heats and expands the upper atmosphere. This increased atmospheric density at satellite altitudes creates more drag on satellites, causing them to lose altitude gradually. This effect is most pronounced for satellites in low-Earth orbit. A few cases of satellite orbit decay have also been noticed (Fig. 12). Orbit decay of EOS-07 at ~430 km with nearly 153 kg mass is nominally 300 meters and on 11 May the decay observed 600meters. Orbit decay of Cartosat-2F at 505 km with mass of nearly 688 kg is normally 35 to 40 meters and on 11 May the decay observed was 180 meters (refer Fig. 13). In general, the orbit decay of all satellites increased by 5 to 6 times compared to nominal value on 11 May 2024. Figure 12: Orbit decay for various satellites on May 10, 2024 Figure 12: Orbit decay for various satellites on May 10, 2024 The ISRO Navigation Centre has not noticed any significant degradation in the NaVIC service metrices till now, indicating no or negligible impact from the geomagnetic storm."

No L band                                         scintillation has been observed. Radar observations showed no bubble, consistent                                         with TEC and scintillation observed by GNSS receivers. While this was the observation from Gadanki, the observations by the Thumba                                         (coordinates 8.5310° N, 76.8750° E) node of the INSWIM (Indian Network for Space                                         Weather Impact Monitoring) network was more dramatic. This is expected, as the                                         ionospheric ring current, which is enhanced during geomagnetic storms, passes                                         over the sky of Thumba.In response to the geomagnetic storm on May 11, 2024 a                                         sharp enhancement in the TEC values was observed at Trivandrum post 8 UT and by                                         10 UT, it lead to over 100 % increase compared to the control day on 09/10 May.                                         About 80 TECu (1 Total Electron Content unit of TECu means 1016 electrons per                                         meter square in a column integrated sense) plasma at 09 AM IST over Trivandrum.                                         It's huge in comparison with the typical value of TEC at the same local time,                                         which is ~10-20 TECu. Observations from Space ISRO has mobilised all its observation platforms and systems to record the                                         signatures of this event. Both Aditya-L1 and Chandrayaan-2 have made                                         observations and signatures have been analysed. Observations by Aditya-L1 Meanwhile, the ASPEX payload on-board Aditya -L1 is showing high speed solar                                         wind, high temperature solar wind plasma and energetic ion flux till now.ASPEX                                         comprises two subsystem instruments – the Solar wind Ion Spectrometer (SWIS) and                                         STEPS (SupraThermal and Energetic Particle Spectrometer). The THA-1 (Top Hat                                         Analyser-1) of SWIS works in species differentiated mode and measures the He++                                         (alpha particles) and H+ ions (protons) separately in 2π radians in the ecliptic                                         plane, while THA-2 (Top Hat Analyser-2) of SWIS works in the species integrated                                         mode in 2π radians across the ecliptic plane. Figure 1 shows the energy                                         histogram for the SWIS sensor in ASPEX., which captures the signature of the                                         solar wind.SWIS has captured the enhancement of the alpha particle and                                             proton                                             flux of the solar wind as a signature of this solar eruptive event. Figure 1: Proton (lower) and alpha (upper) lines are seen from the THA-1 and 2 SWIS observations. The prominent change in the flux is noticed as the signature of this solar eruptive event. The upper and lower panels represent the observations from THA-1 and THA-2 of the SWIS. The colour bar represents the raw counts, in log scale. Figure 2 presents the observations from STEPS. This measures the flux of the                                         solar wind ions at seven energy ranges.A steady rise in the energetic ion                                             fluxes during the event has been noticed. Figure 2: Rise in the ion flux as observed by the STEPS. Each of the curve corresponds to specific energy bands. The X-ray payloads on-board Aditya-L1 (SoLEXS and HEL1OS) have observed the                                             multiple X- and M-class flares from these regions during the last few days                                             while                                             the in-situ magnetometer (MAG) payload has also observed the events as it                                             passed                                             by the L1 point.The observations made by SoLEXS, HEL1OS and MAG                                         payloads are                                         presented in Figures 3, 4 and 5 respectively. Figure 3:LIghtcurve from SoLEXS. It has captured the signatures of the X-class flares in the soft X-Ray regime. Figure 4: Lightcure from HEL1OS. It has also captured X class of flares, in the hard X-Ray regime. Figure 5: The measurements with the MAG payload has captured the perturbations in the Interplanetary Magnetic Field (IMF) caused by the solar eruptions. Observations by Chandrayaan-2 While the Aditya-L1 observes the Sun from the first Sun-Earth Lagrange point,                                         the Chandrayaan-2 orbiter has also captured the signatures of these solar                                         eruptive events from the lunar polar orbit. XSM has observed many interesting                                         phenomena associated with this geomagnetic storm. Figure 6 shows the solar X-ray                                         flux in the 1 – 8 A range (the same range used by NOAA GOES). The large solar                                         flares (> M5 class), manifested as spikes, are autonomously identified by the                                         onboard logic of XSM, when the internal mechanism was activated to reduce the                                         incident X-ray flux by bringing a filter in front of the detector, so as to                                         prevent its saturation. While the XSM primarily monitors solar X-rays, it has also provided                                             information                                             about the local high energy particle environment by means of counting the                                             events                                             when the upper level discriminator (ULD) threshold is crossed.The ULD                                         event                                         light curve over the past five days, shown in Figure 7, clearly shows the                                         enhancement of the local charge particle concentration from 9th May onwards. The                                         dips observed in the XSM ULD light curve are due to the shadow effect arising                                         from orbit of the spacecraft around the Moon. Figure 6: Chandrayaan-2 XSM light curve of 1-8 angstrom X-ray flux.   The gaps in the light curve are due to the Sun going out of the XSM field of view as the Chandrayaan-2 spacecraft orbits around the Moon. For more details about the observational aspects of XSM, please check the XSM website at https://www.prl.res.in/ch2xsm/ Figure 7: Variability of high-energy particles in the lunar orbit from ULD events observed by Chandrayaan-2 XSM On the Spacecraft Health The Master Control Facility (MCF) team in ISROwas on alert and watchful of any                                         Geomagnetic activity experienced by geo spacecrafts. With respect to                                         disturbances on spacecrafts, the magnetic torquer duty cycle changes due to                                         increased accumulation of disturbances resulting in frequent momentum dumps. Momentum Wheel speed deviations were observed along with MTC current saturation                                         in few spacecrafts. Spacecrafts with one-sided panel had predominant signature                                         variations which required frequent momentum dumping. Otherwise, overall                                         operations were normal. No single event upsets were seen.Star Sensor (SS-2) in                                         INSAT-3DS and Star Sensor (SS-3) in INSAT-3DR were turned off as per Mission. Other than this there has not been any major upsets or anomaly observed in any of the 30 GEO spacecrafts so far. None of the Earth Observation Satellites of ISRO which were visible from ISRO’s ground stations had any upsets or latch-ups. During solar events like this, the energy released from the Sun heats and expands the upper atmosphere. This increased atmospheric density at satellite altitudes creates more drag on satellites, causing them to lose altitude gradually. This effect is most pronounced for satellites in low-Earth orbit. A few cases of satellite orbit decay have also been noticed (Fig 8). Orbit decay of EOS-07 at ~430 km with nearly 153 kg mass is nominally 300 meters and on 11 May the decay observed 600meters. Orbit decay of Cartosat-2F at 505 km with mass of nearly 688 kg is normally 35 to 40 meters and on 11 may the decay observed was 180 meters (refer Fig. 9). In general, the orbit decay of all satellites increased by 5 to 6 times compared to nominal valueon 11 May 2024. Figure 8: Orbit decay for various satellites on May 10, 2024 Figure 9: Table presenting the orbit decay due to atmospheric drag for the LEO satellites on May 11, 2024 The ISRO Navigation Centre has not noticed any significant degradation in the NaVIC service metrices till now, indicating no or negligible impact from the geomagnetic storm."

"event/ISRO_successfully_conducts_long-duration_hot_tests_of_Additive_Manufactured_Liquid_Engine.","has_description","May 10, 2024 ISRO achieved a major milestone with the successful hot testing of liquid rocket engine manufactured through Additive Manufacturing (AM) technology for a duration of 665 s on May 9, 2024. The engine used is the PS4 engine of PSLV upper stage. The PS4 engine manufactured in the conventional machining and welding route has been in use for the fourth stage of PSLV which has a thrust of 7.33 kN in vacuum condition. The same engine is also used in the Reaction Control System (RCS) of the first stage (PS1) of PSLV. The engine uses the earth-storable bipropellant combinations of Nitrogen Tetroxide as oxidizer and Mono Methyl Hydrazine as fuel in pressure-fed mode and was developed by the Liquid Propulsion Systems Centre (LPSC), ISRO. LPSC redesigned the engine making it amenable to the Design for Additive Manufacturing (DfAM) concept thereby gaining considerable advantages. The Laser Powder Bed Fusion technique employed has brought down the number of parts from 14 to a single-piece, and eliminated 19 weld joints, saving significantly on the raw material usage per engine (13.7 kg of metal powder compared to the 565 kg of forgings and sheets for conventional manufacturing process) and reduced 60% in the overall production time. The manufacturing of the engine was done in the Indian industry (M/s WIPRO 3D), and the engine was hot tested at ISRO Propulsion Complex, Mahendragiri. PS4 engine realized through AM route PS4 engine during hot test As part of the development programme, the injector head of the engine was realised and successfully hot tested earlier. Detailed flow and thermal modelling, structural simulation, and cold flow characterisation of the proto hardware were carried out to gain confidence for the hot test. Consequently, four successful developmental hot tests of integrated engine were conducted for a cumulative duration of 74 s which validated the engine performance parameters. Furthermore, the engine was successfully tested for the full qualification duration of 665 s and observed that all the performance parameters were as expected. It is planned to induct this AM PS4 engine into the regular PSLV program. The performance of the engine during the long-duration test is shown in the following graph."

"event/Successful_ignition_test_on_Semi_Cryogenic_Pre-Burner_Ignition_Test_Article_(PITA)","has_description","May 6, 2024 ISRO is developing a 2000 kN thrust semi-cryogenic engine working on an LOX Kerosene propellant combination for enhancing the payload capability of LVM3 and for future launch vehicles. Liquid Propulsion Systems Centre (LPSC) is the lead centre for the development of semi-cryogenic propulsion systems with the support of other launch vehicle centres of ISRO. The assembly and testing of the propulsion modules were done at the ISRO propulsion complex (IPRC), Mahendragiri. As part of the engine development, a pre-burner ignition test article, which is a full complement of the engine power head system excluding the turbopumps is realized. The first ignition trial was conducted successfully on May 2, 2024, at semi cryo integrated engine test facility (SIET) at IPRC, Mahendragiri, which was dedicated to the nation recently by the honorable Prime Minister of India. Smooth and sustained ignition of the preburner is demonstrated which is vital for the starting of the semi-cryogenic engine. Semi-cryogenic engine ignition is achieved using a start fuel ampule which uses a combination of Triethyle Alumnide and Triethyle Boron developed by VSSC and used for the first time in ISRO in the 2000 kN semi-cryogenic engine. Many injector elemental level ignition tests were conducted at the Propulsion Research Laboratory Division (PRLD) facility of Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre (VSSC) for characterization. The ignition process is one of the most critical parts in the development of liquid rocket engine systems. With the successful ignition of the semi-cryo pre burner, a major milestone in the semi-cryo engine development has been achieved. This will be followed by development tests on the engine powerhead test article and fully integrated engine. The development of a semi-cryo stage with 120 tons of propellant loading is also under progress. The successful ignition of a semi-cryo preburner is a major accomplishment of ISRO in the development of semi-cryogenic propulsion systems. Figure 1 Preburner ignition test article and Hot test"

VSSC, continuing its pioneering work in space research, has leveraged advanced                                         materials like Carbon-Carbon (C-C) Composites to create a nozzle divergent that                                         offers exceptional properties. By utilizing processes such as carbonization of                                         green composites, Chemical Vapor Infiltration, and High-Temperature Treatment,                                         it has produced a nozzle with low density, high specific strength, and excellent                                         stiffness, capable of retaining mechanical properties even at elevated                                         temperatures. A key feature of the C-C nozzle is its special anti-oxidation coating of Silicon                                         Carbide, which extends its operational limits in oxidizing environments. This                                         innovation not only reduces thermally induced stresses but also enhances                                         corrosion resistance, allowing for extended operational temperature limits in                                         hostile environments. The potential impact of this development is significant, particularly for the                                         Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO)'s workhorse launcher, the Polar                                         Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV). The PS4, the fourth stage of the PSLV,                                         currently employs twin engines with nozzles made from Columbium alloy. However,                                         by replacing these metallic divergent nozzles with C-C counterparts, a mass                                         reduction of approximately 67% can be achieved. This substitution is projected                                         to increase the payload capability of the PSLV by 15 kg, a notable enhancement                                         for space missions. The successful testing of the C-C nozzle divergent marked a major milestone for                                         ISRO. On March 19, 2024, a 60-second hot test was conducted at the High-Altitude                                         Test (HAT) facility in ISRO Propulsion Complex (IPRC), Mahendragiri, confirming                                         the system's performance and hardware integrity. Subsequent tests, including a                                         200-second hot test on April 2, 2024, further validated the nozzle's                                         capabilities, with temperatures reaching 1216K, matching predictions. The collaborative effort involved the Liquid Propulsion Systems Centre (LPSC) at                                         Valiamala which designed and configured the testand IPRC, Mahendragiri which                                         conducted the instrumentation and execution of the tests at their HAT facility.

"event/PSLV_accomplishes_zero_orbital_debris_mission","has_description","March 25, 2024 Another milestone was achieved by ISRO on March 21, 2024, when the PSLV Orbital Experimental Module-3 (POEM-3) met its fiery end through a re-entry into the Earth’s atmosphere. The PSLV-C58/XPoSat mission has practically left zero debris in orbit. The PSLV-C58 Mission was accomplished on January 1, 2024. After completing the primary mission of injecting all satellites into their desired orbits, the terminal stage of PSLV was transformed into a 3-axis stabilized platform, the POEM-3. The stage was de-orbited from 650 km to 350 km, which facilitated its early re-entry, and was passivated to remove residual propellants to minimize any accidental break-up risks. POEM-3 was configured with a total of 9 different experimental payloads to carry out technology demonstrations and scientific experiments on the newly developed indigenous systems. Out of these, 6 payloads were delivered by NGEs through IN-SPACe. The mission objectives of these payloads were met in a month. The orbital altitude of the upper stage continued to decay under the influence of natural forces, primarily atmospheric drag with the module (NORAD ID 58695) expected to have impacted the North Pacific Ocean (Lat 6.4 N & Long 158.7 W) on March 21, 2024, at 14:04 UTC (19:34 Hrs. IST). Through the POEM, which serves as a very cost-effective platform for carrying out short-duration space-borne experiments, ISRO has opened up new vistas for academia, startups, and NGEs to experiment with their new payloads. This novel opportunity has been effectively utilized by numerous startups, universities, and NGEs for carrying out experiments in space, which included electric thrusters, satellite dispensers, and star-tracking. POEM also incorporates new features such as total avionics in single-chain configuration, industrial-grade components in avionics packages including Mission Management Computer, standard interfaces for electric power, telemetry & telecommand, and new in-orbit navigation algorithms making use of rate-gyro, sun sensor, and magnetometer. For the effective conduct of experiments onboard in POEM-3, the body rates were stabilized to less than 0.5 deg/s throughout, and innovative schemes like controlled dumping of residual propellant after the main mission were introduced for minimizing disturbances due to passivation. The Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre (VSSC) has taken the lead in conceptualizing and realizing the POEM by augmenting the 4th stage of PSLV. PSLV-C58/XPoSat is the third such mission in the series, with POEMs being successfully scripted each time. The payload operations were carried out effectively by the spacecraft operations team from the mission operations complex (MOX) at ISTRAC and ISRO's System for Safe and Sustainable Spacecraft Operations Management (IS4OM) has been monitoring and analyzing the orbital decay all through. Till near re-entry, POEM-3 was tracked by ISTRAC ground stations. The Multi-Object Tracking Radar (MOTR) at Shriharikota also tracked the PS4 stage till the morning of March 21. POEM-3 was also supported by other Centres like URSC, LPSC and IISU. ISRO will continue its commitment to providing a cost-effective orbital experiment platform. As the growing menace due to space debris, especially with multiple small satellite constellations coming up, poses a significant threat to space activities, including satellite launches, human spaceflight, and space exploration missions, ISRO, being a responsible space agency, is committed to mitigating this threat through the development and implementation of advanced debris tracking systems, space-object deorbiting technologies, and responsible satellite deployment practices, thus safeguarding orbital environments for present and future space endeavors.

"event/ISRO_achieves_yet_another_success_in_the_RLV_Landing_Experiment","has_description","March 22, 2024 ISRO has achieved a major milestone in the area of Reusable launch vehicle (RLV) technology, through the RLV LEX-02 landing experiment, the second of the series,  conducted at Aeronautical Test Range (ATR), Chitradurga in Karnataka today morning at 7:10 hrs IST. After the RLV-LEX-01 mission was accomplished last year, RLV-LEX-02 demonstrated the autonomous landing capability of RLV from off-nominal initial conditions at release from Helicopter. The RLV was made to undertake more difficult manoeuvres with dispersions,   correct both cross-range and downrange and land on the runway in a fully autonomous mode.  The winged vehicle, called Pushpak, was lifted by an Indian Airforce Chinook helicopter and was released from 4.5 km altitude. After release at a distance of 4 km from the runway, Pushpak autonomously approached the runway along with cross-range corrections. It landed precisely on the runway and came to a halt using its brake parachute, landing gear brakes and nose wheel steering system. This mission successfully simulated the approach and high-speed landing conditions of RLV returning from space. With this second mission, ISRO has re-validated the indigenously developed technologies in the areas of navigation, control systems, landing gear and deceleration systems essential for performing a high-speed autonomous landing of a space-returning vehicle. The winged body and all flight systems used in RLV-LEX-01 were reused in the RLV-LEX-02 mission after due certification/clearances. Hence reuse capability of flight hardware and flight systems is also demonstrated in this mission. Based on the observations from RLV-LEX-01, the airframe structure and landing gear were strengthened to tolerate higher landing loads. The mission was accomplished by Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre (VSSC) along with the Liquid Propulsion System Centre (LPSC) and the ISRO Inertial Systems Unit (IISU).  Collaboration from various agencies including IAF, ADE, ADRDE and CEMILAC contributed to the success of this mission. Shri S Somanath, Chairman, ISRO / Secretary, DOS, congratulated the team for the flawless execution of this complex mission. On the success of the landing experiment,  Director VSSC Dr S Unnikrishnan Nair mentioned that through this repeated success, ISRO could master the terminal phase manouvering, landing and energy management in a fully autonomous mode, which is a critical step towards the future  Orbital Re-entry missions The team was guided by  Shri Sunil P, Programme Director, Advanced Technology and Systems Programme, VSSC. Shri J Muthupandian, Project Director, RLV was the Mission Director and Shri B Karthik, Deputy Project Director, RLV was the Vehicle Director for this mission. For the success of this experiment, ISTRAC provided tracking support, SAC provided a Pseudolite system and a Ka-band Radar Altimeter, LPSC offered all pressure sensors on the wing body, IISU provided navigation hardware/software and an integrated solution. Metrological and wind measurement support was provided by SDSC-SHAR, and URSC offered ground power support.

"event/INSAT-3DS_begins_imaging_the_Earth","has_description","March 11, 2024 INSAT-3DS, the meteorological satellite, has initiated Earth imaging operations. The first set of images by the meteorological payloads (6-channel Imager and 19-channel Sounder) was captured on March 7, 2024. The satellite was launched on February 17, 2024. After completing orbit-raising operations, the satellite reached the designated geostationary slot for the In Orbit Testing (IOT) on February 28, 2024. IOT of the Satellite Communications was conducted between February 29, 2024, and March 3, 2024. As part of Meteorological Payload IOT, the first session of imaging for Imager and Sounder payloads was carried out on March 7, 2024. The payload parameters are found to be nominal, complying with payload specifications. Thus, all the payloads of INSAT-3DS have been tested to perform nominally. Imager and Sounder payloads onboard 3DS are similar to the payloads flown on 3D and 3DR. Significant improvements have been achieved in radiometric accuracy, black body calibration, thermal management, and imaging throughput, among others. The payloads are designed and developed at the Space Applications Centre (SAC), Ahmedabad. The first images are processed and released at the Master Control Facility, Hasan. The 6-channel imager equipment captures images of the Earth's surface and atmosphere across multiple spectral channels or wavelengths. The use of multiple channels allows for gathering information about various atmospheric and surface phenomena, such as clouds, aerosols, land surface temperature, vegetation health, and water vapour distribution. The imager could be configured to capture specific features of interest. The 19-channel sounder captures radiation emitted by the Earth's atmosphere through channels carefully chosen to capture radiation emitted by different atmospheric constituents and properties like water vapour, ozone, carbon dioxide, and other gases, while others may be designed to measure temperature variations in different layers of the atmosphere. These Payloads generate over 40 geophysical data products such as Sea Surface Temperature, Rainfall (precipitation) Products, Land Surface Temperature, Fog Intensity, Outgoing Longwave Radiation, Atmospheric Motion Vectors, High-Resolution Winds, Upper Tropospheric Humidity, Cloud Properties, Smoke, Fire, Mean Surface Pressure, Temperature Profiles, Water Vapor Profiles, Surface Skin Temperature, Total Ozone, etc., for the user community. The data collected derive information about the vertical structure of the atmosphere, crucial for weather forecasting, climate monitoring, and understanding atmospheric processes.

"event/Honourable_Prime_Minister_Lays_the_Foundation_Stone_for_India's_Second_Spaceport","has_description","February 28, 2024 In a momentous occasion for India's space ambitions, Hon’ble Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi remotely laid the foundation stone for India's second spaceport at Kulasekharapattinam, a coastal village in Tamil Nadu's Thoothukudi district on February 28, 2024, at 09:45 hrs. The selection of Kulasekharapattinam offers strategic advantages, particularly in enhancing payload capability with its direct southward launch trajectory for small launch vehicles. The ceremony saw the esteemed presence of Shri Somanath S, Chairman, ISRO and Secretary, Department of Space (DoS), Dr. Pawan Kumar Goenka, Chairman, IN-SPACe and other senior officials. The highlight of the event was the successful launch of the Rohini Sounding Rocket ""RH200"" from the newly established launch complex at 13:40 hrs IST. VSSC provided the rocket and the meteorological payload, while SDSC spearheaded the realization and installation of launch facilities including radars, launchers, and electronic systems. The maiden launch from the new spaceport marked a significant milestone, with the RH200 rocket reaching a peak altitude of 75 km, precisely tracked by two on-site radars. The RH200 rocket, developed by VSSC, has a long-standing reputation for reliability, with this launch marking its 1928thsuccessful mission. Chairman, ISRO, Shri Somanath S., stated that today marks a historic day in the Indian space program as the Honorable PM laid the foundation for the second launch site, and a sounding rocket was successfully launched from the Kulasekharapattinam launch station. He further added that the launch site will be fully commissioned within 24 months and will enhance the space activities of NGEs. Preparation for the RH200 Launch The launch complex requirements were fulfilled through a comprehensive array of infrastructure facilities meticulously planned and executed within the shortest possible time at the new launch complex at Kulasai. The coordinated efforts of VSSC, IPRC, ISRO HQ, IISU, and SDSC-SHAR exemplified the cohesive teamwork within ISRO. The RH 200 launch facilities were strategically laid out within the existing layout of SSLV facilities, adhering to stringent safety distance criteria. The sounding rocket launch pad coordinates were aligned with the IISU. Launchpad infrastructure, including integration & check-out facilities, assembly halls for preparation, and launch area services, were strategically grouped and sited into different zones considering functional requirements and local terrain. The RH 200 launcher and associated systems were relocated from SDSC-SHAR and were erected, commissioned, and tested. Moreover, the portable radar of 10kw / 100µs pulse, a solid-state transmitter capable of tracking the chaff, was realized in-house with spare systems within two months. It underwent rigorous validation through continuous balloon-tracking trials. For safe transportation of the RH 200 rocket within the launch complex, existing roads were augmented and strengthened, stretching approximately 3-4 km, transforming muddy roads into flight-worthy routes. A comprehensive range-clearance procedure, safety and contingency plan, logistic arrangements, launch view galleries, medical facilities, fire tenders, and coastal boat patrolling, akin to SDSC-SHAR, were meticulously established, culminating in the safe and successful launch of the RH200.

"event/PAPA_payload_aboard_Aditya-L1_detects_solar_wind_impact_of_Coronal_Mass_Ejections","has_description","February 22, 2024 The Plasma Analyser Package for Aditya (PAPA) payload onboard the Aditya-L1 has been operational and performing nominally. Its advanced sensors have successfully detected the impact of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) including those that occurred during February 10-11, 2024. PAPA is an energy and mass analyzer designed for in-situ measurements of solar wind electrons and ions in the low energy range. It has two sensors: the Solar Wind Electron Energy Probe (SWEEP, measuring electrons in the energy range of 10 eV to 3 keV) and the Solar Wind Ion Composition Analyser (SWICAR, measuring ions in the energy range of 10 eV to 25 keV and mass range of 1-60 amu). The sensors are also equipped to measure the direction of arrival of solar wind particles. The payload has been operational since  December 12, 2023. Its observations during the Halo Orbit Insertion (HOI) phase are shown in Figure 1. The figure illustrates the time series of SWEEP electron energy spectra and total count observed during the HOI phase and the period preceding and succeeding it. It reveals about three-order magnitude change in electron counts from 10 eV to 3000 eV. The majority of electrons have energy below 40 eV. It displays an excellent signal-to-noise ratio and energy resolution. Drastic reduction in the electron energy spectra and the total count occurs during the HOI phase due to the change in payload orientation away from the sun direction during this orbit maneuvering period. This is also evident in the ion energy spectra observed using SWICAR (Figure 2). Figure 1: Time series of SWEEP electron energy spectra taken from 04:00:30 UTC to 17:59:58 UTC on January 6, 2024, covering Pre-HOI, HOI and Post-HOI phases. The dip seen in the spectra is due to spacecraft rotation (HOI phase) when the sensor direction is away from the Sun.  The time series of the integrated counts are shown in the upper panel. Figure 2 shows the time series of SWICAR ion energy spectra and integrated counts during the specified timeframe. It exhibits the expected patterns of ion energy spectra under normal space weather conditions. The ion energy spectrum indicates the dominance of protons (H+ @ 1 amu at around 800 eV) and alpha particles (He++ @ 2 amu at around 1600 eV). The ability of SWICAR to identify individual ion masses aligns with its design. The electron (SWEEP) and ion (SWICAR) energy spectra observed before and after the HOI phase are comparable. Figure 2: Time series of SWICAR ion energy spectra and the integrated counts from 04:01:36UTC to 17:58:53 UTC on January 6, 2024 (Top two panels) showing the variations during Pre-HOI, HOI and Post-HOI phases. The observed energy-direction spectrogram (bottom panel) shows two dominant species (H+ and He++) in the solar wind and their angular variations. The data collected by PAPA revealed the occurrence of Coronal Mass Ejection (CME) events, notably on December 15, 2023, and during February 10-11, 2024, as shown in Figures 3 and 4. The CME on December 15, 2023, was a single event. PAPA observations during this period (Figure 3) showed an abrupt increase in total electron and ion counts and the time variations align with the solar wind parameters and magnetic field measurements obtained from the Deep Space Climate Observatory (DSCOVR) and Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE) satellites at the L1 point. In contrast, the observed variations in electron and ion counts during February 10-11, 2024 are the result of multiple minor events, with differences in the time variations of electrons and ions. Figure 3: Time series of the integrated raw counts for (a) solar wind electrons measured by PAPA-SWEEP sensor, and (b) solar wind ions measured by PAPA-SWICAR sensor, from 05:45:00 UT on 15 December to 23:55:00 UT on 16 December 2023. (c) The corresponding time series of the total magnetic field measured at the L1 point by DSCOVR and ACE (obtained from SWPC). Figure 4: Similar to Figure 3, for the CMEs occurred during February 10-11, 2024. The SWEEP and SWICAR sensors on PAPA-Aditya-L1 are currently making continuous observations of solar wind electrons and ions in the default mode, demonstrating that they are performing as per the design in all modes of operations. The observations made by PAPA emphasize its effectiveness in monitoring space weather conditions and its capability to detect and analyze solar phenomena. The PAPA payload is developed by the Space Physics Laboratory and Avionics Entity of the Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre (VSSC)/ISRO."

The plot illustrates the time window of X-rays scattered by the Beryllium scatterer inside POLIX, originally emitted from the Crab pulsar. This plot represents the first of its kind in this energy range. The data in lower and greater than this energy range are available from different missions. The X-axis indicates the time for two pulses, about 67 ms in total. The plot also has the timing of non-pulsed emission components from the Pulsar Wind Nebula surrounding the pulsar. The time window facilitates determining the X-rays emitted from the pulsar (but not from the wind nebula). The polarization of X-rays from the source is detectable as the degree of asymmetry in the scattering of X-rays in the instrument depends on the polarization of the incoming X-rays. The POLIX payload was activated in two stages by January 10, 2024, and initial scan observations were conducted around the Crab pulsar, the intended first target. The data plotted was collected during January 15-18, 2024, and thoroughly reviewed for confirmation. The data aligns with expectations. This initial observation is a significant milestone for POLIX, showcasing its functionality and readiness for investigating pulsars, black holes, and other astronomical sources. As the sole payload offering data in this energy band, POLIX is poised to offer unique insights and contribute to understanding the physical processes associated with Astronomical X-ray sources. POLIX was designed and developed by the X-ray Astronomy Laboratory at Raman Research Institute, Bengaluru. The instrument is built indigenously with the support from Indian industry. The other instrument,XSPECT, onboard XPoSat is ready for observations. Crab nebula (Image courtesy:NASA/STScI) Crab pulsar residing at the center of Crab Nebula (Image courtesy:NASA/STScI)"

"event/POEM-3_Mission_achieves_all_its_Payload_objectives","has_description","January 27, 2024 POEM-3, the PSLV Orbital Experimental Module-3, India’s unique inexpensive space platform using the spent PS4 stage of the PSLV-C58 vehicle that launched XPoSat on January 1, 2024, has successfully achieved all its objectives. After deploying the satellite into its intended orbit at 650 km, the vehicle was lowered to 350 km circular orbit to minimize the time of orbit decay after completion of the experiment. It is a three-axis-attitude controlled platform with power generation and telecommand & telemetry capabilities, for supporting Payloads. By 25th day in orbit, POEM-3 completed 400 orbits. Its current orbit measures around 322 km by 352 km. It is predicted that POEM-3 will continue orbiting for approximately 73 more days before re-entering the Earth’s atmosphere. POEM-3 flew with nine Payloads from VSSC, PRL, Academia, and Space start-ups inducted through IN-SPACe. Over this period, each payload was put into operation, as planned and performance was demonstrated. The experiments of ARKA200 (Xenon Based Electric Propulsion) and RUDRA (HAN based Green Propellant Thruster) from Bellatrix, and LEAP-TD (Satellite Bus with VHF/UHF Downlink & UHF Uplink – Tested using IIST ground station) from Dhruva Space were completed. Payload Data is collected regularly for WeSAT (Solar irradiance and UV Index study) from LBS Institute of Technology for Women, BeliefSat0(Amateur Radio satellite) from KJ Somayia Institute of Technology, RSEM (Radiation Shielding experiment) from TakeMe2Space, and DEX (interplanetary Dust particle experiment) from PRL for every orbit. 100 W Fuel Cell Power System(FCPS) and Si-C based High Power Li-Ion (10AH/32V) Battery from VSSC were also demonstrated. Thus all payload objectives were fully met. In missions of POEM-1 to POEM-3, ISRO has flown a total of 21 payloads from various institutes and industries. After achieving all objectives, more experiments with POEM-3 are planned for generating data for future missions including upcoming POEM configurations.  With the orbital decay and reentry of POEM-3 in three months, PSLV-C58 XPoSat mission will be leaving zero debris in space."

"event/SSPACE/IIST_lends_tracking_support_to_space_startup","has_description","January 25, 2024 The Indian Institute of Space Science and Technology (IIST), (an autonomous                                         institution under the Department of Space), is an institute of excellence for                                         education and research in Space Technology, Space Science and Space Application.                                         IIST offers specialized courses in Avionics & Aerospace Engineering and Applied                                         Sciences starting from undergraduate to doctoral and postdoctoral programmes.                                         IIST enjoys close links with ISRO Centres and Units for the use of facilities                                         and research materials. In the recent PSLV C-58 XPoSat mission launched on the new year day, IIST played                                         a pivotal role in extending telemetry and telecommand support to the space                                         start-up Dhruva Space. The POEM orbiting platform of PSLV C58 has 9 payloads                                         including LEAP-TD from Hyderbased based space start-up Dhruva Space. Dhruva Space, Hyderabad, a pioneer among space startups in India working in the                                         area of small satellite systems development, has developed a payload called                                         LEAP-TD for technology demonstration of key systems including telemetry                                         telecommand modules in addition to many other subsystems. Small-satellite and payloads need tracking for telemetry and telecommand by a                                         reliable Ground Station typically in VHF, UHF and S-band. For this purpose IIST                                         has established a ground station which is fully developed and supported by                                         student/staff of IIST and guided by talented professors and experts from ISRO                                         centers. In this regard, four LEO missions, InspireSat1 satellite and POEM                                         payloads PILOT, ARIS-1, ARIS-2 have been developed and launched from IIST.                                         Multiple futuristic satellites and payloads for science exploration and                                         technology demonstration are being developed by students. In this way IIST is                                         creating industry ready students with knowledge of cutting-edge technologies in                                         the space sector. Success of any satellite mission lies with the communication from ground for                                         telemetry and telecommand. In this IIST played a pivotal role through                                         Small-spacecraft Systems and PAyload CEntre (SSPACE), Ground Station tracking                                         systems including antenna and RF systems for Telemetry and Telecommand                                         operations round the clock. IIST has provided ground support to satellites                                         including InspireSat1, InspireSat2, InspireSat4 and POEM payload on PSLV C53,                                         and PSLV C58 mission. The LEAP-TD payload in the POEM platform is in a ~350 km low earth orbit with an                                         orbital period of around 94 mins. Out of five high elevation orbits per day of                                         elevation greater than 30 degrees the orbital platform is visible over IIST for                                         around 10 mins. During this time the ground station has to reliably track the                                         satellite for receiving the telemetry and transmitting the telecommand. A team of 8 members from Dhruva Space are in IIST to augment/adapt and operate                                         the IIST Ground station for supporting the LEAP-TD payload launched in PSLV C58                                         on January 1, 2024. The teams from Dhruva Space and IIST have worked round the                                         clock to configure the ground systems for adapting to the LEAP-TD telemetry and                                         telecommand requirements. IIST and Dhruva Space teams are operating the ground station which received the                                         first beacon and telemetry from LEAP-TD on January 2nd when the payload was                                         switched on for the first time. Since then the payload is being tracked by the                                         ground station periodically and beacon/telemetry signals are being received and                                         telecommand is being sent from the IIST ground station. With this IIST has entered into the domain of services for reliable ground                                         station tracking systems and small satellites providing opportunities for                                         universities and space startups to exploit these facilities on a mutually                                         agreeable basis. In today's world of rapidly advancing space technologies and                                         aligning with the country’s goal IIST has started collaborating with                                         Universities and Industries in building small satellites and payloads using                                         innovative technologies for miniaturizing systems, improving performance,                                         reducing cost and rapid deployment of space assets in space."

"event/Successful_Deployment_of_Magnetometer_Boom_on_Aditya-L1_in_Halo_Orbit","has_description","January 25, 2024 The 6-meter long magnetometer boom on the Aditya-L1 satellite has been                                         successfully deployed. It is deployed in the Halo orbit at the Lagrange point                                         L-1, on January 11, 2024. The boom had been in stowed condition for 132 days                                         since the Aditya-L1 launch. The boom carries two state-of-the-art, high-accuracy fluxgate magnetometer                                         sensors that measure the low intensity interplanetary magnetic field in space.                                         The sensors are deployed at distances of 3 and 6 meters from the spacecraft                                         body. Mounting them at these distances minimizes the impact of the spacecraft                                         generated magnetic field on measurements. , and using two of them assists                                         precise estimation of this influence.The dual sensor system facilitates                                         cancelling out the spacecraft's magnetic influence. The boom segments are constructed from carbon fibre reinforced polymer and serve                                         as interfaces for the sensor mounting and mechanism elements. The articulated                                         boom mechanism comprises 5 segments interconnected through spring-driven hinge                                         mechanisms, allowing for folding and deploying actions. The deployment occurs in                                         an accordion fashion, controlled by a novel patented Kevlar closed control loop                                         mechanism, with hinges locking the segments into the deployed configuration. During the stowed condition, the boom is securely held in position by two                                         hold-downs, transferring launch loads to the spacecraft body. A thermal                                         cutter-based release system is employed to execute the boom deployment on                                         command. Date received through the telemetry switches confirm the hold-down                                         release, first motion, and locking of all hinges. The observed in-orbit                                         deployment time was approximately 9 s, well within the predicted range of 8 to                                         12 s. All telemetry indications for hinge locking and hold-down release were                                         within nominal parameters."

NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) achieved a laser range measurement using the LRA by successfully detecting signals reflected by it on December 12, 2023. The ranging utilized the Lunar Orbiter Laser Altimeter (LOLA) on the LRO. The observation occurred during lunar night time, with the LRO ascending to the east of Chandrayaan-3. NASA’s LRA was accommodated on the Vikram lander under international collaboration. It comprises eight corner-cube retroreflectors on a hemispherical support structure. This array facilitates laser ranging from various directions by any orbiting spacecraft with suitable instrument. The passive optical instrument, weighing about 20 grams, is designed to last for decades on the lunar surface. Landed near the lunar south pole on August 23, 2023, Chandrayaan-3’s Vikram lander has been accessible for LOLA measurements since then. While several LRAs have been deployed on the Moon since the beginning of lunar exploration, the LRA on Chandrayaan-3 is a miniature version and is the only one available near south pole currently. NASA’s LRA on Chandrayaan-3’s Vikram lander will continue to serve as a long-term geodetic station and a location marker on the lunar surface, benefitting current and future lunar missions. These measurements, apart from helping in precise determination of spacecraft’s orbital position, will help refine the lunar geodetic frame, revealing insights into the Moon's dynamics, internal structure, and gravitational anomalies.

"event/Inauguration_of_Second_Generation_Distress_Alert_Terminal","has_description","January 16, 2024 Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) has developed an indigenous technological solution namely Distress Alert Transmitter (DAT) for the fishermen at sea to send emergency messages from fishing boats. The messages are sent through a communication satellite and received at a central control station (INMCC: Indian Mission Control Centre) where the alert signals are decoded for the identity and location of the fishing boat. The extracted information is forwarded to Maritime Rescue Co-ordination Centres (MRCCs) under Indian Coast Guard (ICG). Using this information the MRCC co-ordinates to undertake Search and Rescue operations to save the fishermen at distress. The DAT is operational since 2010 and till now more than 20000 DATs are being used. Further, taking advantage of technological developments in satellite communication and satellite navigation ISRO has improvised DAT with advanced capabilities and features evolving to Second Generation DAT (DAT-SG). The DAT-SG has the facility to send back acknowledgement to the fishermen who activates the distress alert from sea. This gives an assurance to him of rescue coming to him. Apart from transmitting distress signal from Sea, DAT-SG has the capability to receive messages from control centre. Using this, advance alert messages can be sent to the fishermen at sea whenever there are events of bad weather, cyclone tsunami or any other emergencies. Thus, the fishermen will be able to sail back home or go to safe places. Further, the information about Potential Fishing Zones (PFZs) are also transmitted to fishermen using DAT-SG on regular intervals. This helps fishermen to get good yield in the catch and savings in terms of time and fuel. DAT-SG can be connected to mobile phones using Bluetooth interface and the messages can be read in native language using an App in the mobile. The central control centre (INMCC) has a web based network management system called “SAGARMITRA” which maintain a database of registered DAT-SGs and helps MRCCs to access the information about boat, coordinate the boat at distress in real time. This helps Indian Coast Guard to undertake Search & Rescue operations at the time of distresses, without any time delay. Shri S. Somanath, Secretary, DOS/ Chairman, ISRO declared the services of DAT-SG operational, in the presence of Shri Rakesh Pal, Director General, Indian Coast Guard on 15th January 2024 at INMCC, ISTRAC, Bangalore.  The services of DAT-SG are declared operational on 24 x 7 basis."

"event/XSPECT_payload_performance_verified_with_Cas_A_observation","has_description","January 11, 2024 The XSPECT payload on XPoSat, India's first X-ray polarimetric mission, has captured its first light from the Cassiopeia A (Cas A) supernova remnant. Launched on January 1, 2024, XPoSat carries two co-aligned instruments, POLarimeter Instrument in X-rays (POLIX) and X-ray SPECtroscopy and Timing (XSPECT), aimed at unravelling the mysteries of cosmic X-ray sources. While the POLIX instrument focuses on investigating X-ray polarization in medium-energy X-rays, the XSPECT payload, engages in continuous and long-term spectral and temporal studies of X-ray sources in the soft X-ray band. During its performance verification phase, XSPECT was directed towards Cassiopeia A, a standard celestial source used for instrument evaluation. The observation commenced on January 5, 2024, capturing the supernova remnant's emission lines corresponding to elements such as Magnesium, Silicon, Sulphur, Argon, Calcium, and Iron. Figure 1: XSPECT sees supernova remnant Cassiopeia A (Cas A). The spectrum includes both Galactic Cosmic Ray (GCR) background and Cosmic X-ray Background (CXB). The flux above 8 keV is mainly due to both CXB and GCR. The spectrum shown in Figure is for a total integration time of 20 ksec collected over multiple orbits. XSPECT payload is developed by the Space Astronomy Group of U R Rao Satellite Centre (URSC)/ISRO, Bengaluru. The continuous observations facilitated by XSPECT's long-duration capabilities are anticipated to contribute significantly to our understanding of the universe's high-energy phenomena."

"event/Halo-Orbit_Insertion_of_Aditya-L1_Successfully_Accomplished","has_description","January 6, 2024 Halo-Orbit Insertion (HOI) of its solar observatory spacecraft, Aditya-L1 was accomplished at 16.00             Hrs (approx) on January 6, 2024 (IST). The final phase of the maneuver involved firing of control             engines for a short duration. The orbit of Aditya-L1 spacecraft is a  periodic Halo orbit which is located roughly 1.5  million km               from earth on  the continuously moving Sun – Earth line with an orbital period of about 177.86 earth               days. This Halo orbit is a periodic, three-dimensional orbit at L1 involving Sun, Earth and a spacecraft.               This specific halo orbit is selected to ensure a mission lifetime of 5 years, minimising station-keeping               manoeuvres and thus fuel consumption and ensuring a continuous, unobstructed view of sun. Halo orbit insertion The halo orbit insertion process commenced as the spacecraft crossed the XZ plane in the Sun-Earth-             L1 rotating system, with the required orbital state. The insertion maneuver is essential to nullify the             X and Z velocity components and attain the required Y-velocity in the L1 rotating frame for the             required Halo orbit. The targeted Halo-orbit for Aditya-L1 is Ax: 209200 km, Ay : 663200 km and Az :             120000 km (The semi-axes of the 3-dimensional Halo orbit-refer figure). The insertion of Aditya-L1 into this Halo orbit presents a critical mission phase, which demanded             precise navigation and control. A successful insertion further involved constant monitoring along             with the adjustment of the spacecraft's speed and position by using onboard thrusters. The success             of this insertion not only signifies ISRO's capabilities in such complex orbital manoeuvres, but it but             gives confidence to handle future interplanetary missions. Aditya-L1 was designed and realised at UR Rao Satellite Centre (URSC) with participation from             various ISRO centres. The payloads onboard Aditya-L1 were developed by Indian scientific             laboratories, IIA, IUCAA and ISRO. The Aditya-L1 spacecraft was launched by PSLV-C57 on September             2, 2023 from SDSC SHAR, into an elliptical parking orbit (EPO) of 235.6 km by 19502.7 km. From             here, Aditya-L1 embarked on an extraordinary journey towards the Sun-Earth-L1 Lagrange point,             with the help of the onboard propulsion system, increased its orbital size progressively and moved             toward L1 point. Five liquid engine burns (LEB) were executed during Earth orbit phase; gradually             raised the apogee of the EPO in order to attain the desired trajectory with the fifth burn, known as the trans-L1             injection (TL1I) maneuver. The maneuver strategy is carefully devised to minimize             incremental velocity addition (ΔV) for reaching the target L1 halo orbit while restricting the number             of perigee passes to minimize the spacecraft's exposure to the high radiation Van Allen radiation             belts. To address errors during, TL1I phase, a short burn of the engines, called TCM-1 was conducted             on October 5, 2023, and another TCM-2 on December 14, 2023 to ensure compliance with Halo orbit             insertion condition parameters. The spacecraft underwent a cruise phase lasting approximately 110             days to achieve the present condition prior to HOI targeted on January 6, 2024. All the payloads were tested during the pre-commissioning phase and performance of all the payload is confirmed to be satisfactory. The picture below shows the Halo orbit insertion process graphically in a two dimension picture. The Aditya-L1 spacecraft was moving from Earth towards the L1 point in the direction of Sun. The TCM1 &2 firing oriented the spacecraft toward the Halo Orbit, making it reach the HOI condition (which is a minimum fuel consumption condition) as on 6th January 2024 (Marked by the red dot). The final firing was done at this point, making the spacecraft align with the Halo Orbit. If the HOI manoeuvre was not conducted as done today, the spacecraft would have moved in the direction marked (Without HOI). Halo Orbit Insertion in L1 Rotating Frame"

"event/Flight_Demonstration_of_Si-Gr_anode_based_High_Energy_Density_Li-ion_Cells","has_description","January 5, 2024 Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre (VSSC)/ISRO has qualified 10 Ah Silicon–Graphite anode based high energy density Li-ion cells as a low weight and low cost alternative to present cells being used. The flight demonstration of the cells as a battery was successfully completed by powering a resistive load on-board the POEM-3 platform of PSLV-C58. The on-orbit voltage, current and temperature values of the battery were acquired through telemetry and found to match well with the predictions. Compared to conventional Li-ion cells which use pure graphite as anode material, this cell uses Si-Graphite composite as anode material. This helps in accommodating more Lithium ions for a given unit mass of anode material and thus improves the energy density of the cell. In addition to the material change, this cell also employs cost effective hardware which are readily available and a crimped sealing based design which reduces the hardware cost and fabrication cost significantly.  The energy density of the Silicon High energy Li-ion cells is 190 Wh/kg with an operating voltage of 4.2 to 2.8 V, against Lithium-ion cells (157 Wh/kg). During flight the battery system worked for 21 hours in 15 orbits delivering a capacity of 8.9 Ah with final drained voltage of 0.4 V. Before inducting any new systems in operational vehicles &missions, VSSC subjects the system to rigorous qualification and flight demonstration as piggy back payloads. Same approach is followed for these cells also. The capability of the cells to survive and perform in harsh space environment was also successfully demonstrated through the POEM experiment. Based on the confidence gained through this performance, these cells are poised to be used in upcoming operational missions where 35-40% battery mass saving is expected.  The system find application both in space and ground use. 10 Ah Silicon-Graphite anode based High Energy Density Li-ion cells Configuration (Mass: 4.3 kg)"

"event/ISRO’s_Fuel_Cell_flight_tested_in_PSLV_C58","has_description","January 5, 2024 ISRO has successfully tested a 100 W class Polymer Electrolyte Membrane Fuel Cell based Power System (FCPS) in its orbital platform, POEM3, launched onboard PSLV-C58 on  January 1, 2024. The objective of the experiment was to assess Polymer Electrolyte Membrane Fuel cell operation in space and to collect data to facilitate the design of systems for future missions. During the short duration test onboard POEM, 180 W power was generated from Hydrogen and Oxygen gases stored on onboard in high pressure vessels. It provided a wealth of data on performance of various static and dynamic systems that formed part of the power system and the physics at play. Fuel cell payload Hydrogen Fuel Cells produce electricity directly from Hydrogen and Oxygen gases, along with pure water and heat. It is an electric generator which works on electrochemical principles, as in batteries, as against the combustion reactions employed in conventional generators. The ability to produce electricity directly from fuels without any intermediate step renders them very efficient. With water as the only byproduct, they are totally emission free. These features make them ideal candidates for space missions involving humans where electric power, water and heat are essential since a single systems can meet multiple requirements in the mission. Fuel Cells also possess significant societal application potential. They are also considered to be the most appropriate solution to replace the engines of various types vehicles in use today and to power standby power systems. Fuel Cells can provide range and fuel recharge time equaling that of today’s conventional engine, which gives them a distinct advantage over batteries, and are expected to facilitate emission free transportation.  Fuel cell is ideal power source for Space Station as it provides both power and pure water."

SUIT captures images of the Sun's photosphere and chromosphere in this wavelength range using various scientific filters. On November 20, 2023, the SUIT payload was powered ON. Following a successful pre-commissioning phase, the telescope captured its first light science images on December 6, 2023. These unprecedented images, taken using eleven different filters (as shown in Table 1), include the first-ever full-disk representations of the Sun in wavelengths ranging from 200 to 400 nm, excluding Ca II h. The full disk images of the Sun in the Ca II h wavelength has been studied from other observatories. Among the notable features revealed are sunspots, plage, and quiet Sun regions, as marked in the Mg II h image, providing scientists with pioneering insights into the intricate details of the Sun's photosphere and chromosphere. SUIT observations will help scientists study the dynamic coupling of the magnetized solar atmosphere and assist them in placing tight constraints on the effects of solar radiation on Earth's climate The development of SUIT involved a collaborative effort under the leadership of the Inter-University Centre for Astronomy and Astrophysics (IUCAA), Pune. This collaboration included ISRO, the Manipal Academy of Higher Education (MAHE), the Centre for Excellence in Space Science Indian (CESSI) at IISER-Kolkata, the Indian Institute of Astrophysics Bengaluru, the Udaipur Solar Observatory (USO-PRL), and Tezpur University Assam.

"event/Returns_to_home_Earth:_Chandrayaan-3_Propulsion_Module_moved_from_Lunar_orbit_to_Earth's_orbit","has_description","December 04, 2023 In another unique experiment, like the hop experiment on the Vikram Lander, the Propulsion Module (PM) of Chandrayaan-3 was moved from an orbit around Moon to an orbit around Earth. The primary objective of Chandrayaan-3 mission was to demonstrate soft landing near to lunar south polar region and perform experiments using the instruments on Vikram and Pragyaan.The spacecraft was launched on July 14, 2023 on-board LVM3-M4 vehicle from SDSC, SHAR. On August 23rdVikram Lander made its historic touch down on Moon and subsequently Pragyan rover was deployed. The scientific instruments in Lander and Rover were operated continuously for 1 lunar day as per the defined mission life. The mission objectives of Chandrayaan-3 have been completely met. With regard to Propulsion Module, the main objective was to ferry the Lander module from GTO to the final lunar polar circular orbit and separate the Lander. Subsequent to separation, Spectro-polarimetry of HAbitable Planet Earth (SHAPE) payload in the PM was also operated. The initial plan was to operate this payload for about three months during the mission life of PM. The precise orbit injection by LVM3 and optimal earth / lunar burn maneuvers, resulted in the availability of over 100 kg of fuel in the PM after over one month of operations in the lunar orbit. It was decided to use the available fuel in the PM to derive additional information for future lunar missions and demonstrate the mission operation strategiesfor a sample return mission. In order to continue SHAPE payload for Earth observation, it was decided to re-orbit the PM to a suitable Earth orbit.This mission plan was worked out considering the collision avoidance such as preventing the PM from crashing on to the Moon’s surface or entering into the Earth’s GEO belt at 36000 km and orbits below that. Considering the estimated fuel availability and the safety to GEO spacecrafts, the optimal Earth return trajectory was designed for October 2023 month. First maneuver was performed on October 9, 2023 to raise apolune altitude to 5112 km from 150 km thus, increasing the period of orbit from 2.1 hrs to 7.2 hrs. Later, considering the estimate of available propellant, the second maneuver plan was revised to target an Earth orbit of 1.8 lakhs x 3.8 lakhs km. The Trans-Earthinjection (TEI)maneuver was performed on October 13, 2023. In thepost-TEI maneuver realized orbit, propulsion module made four Moon fly-bys before departing Moon SOI on November 10. Currently, propulsion module is orbiting Earth and crossedits first perigee on November 22ndwith an altitude of 1.54 lakhs km. The orbit period is nearly 13 days with 27 deg inclination. The perigee and apogee altitude vary during its trajectory and the predicted minimum perigee altitude is 1.15 lakhs km. Hence as per current orbit prediction, there is no threats of close approach with any operational Earth orbiting satellites. As per plan, SHAPE payload is being operated whenever Earth is in its field of view. Also, a special operation of the SHAPE payload was carried out on October 28, 2023 during a lunar Eclipse.The Shape payload operations will continue further. UR Rao Satellite Centre/ISRO’s flight dynamics team has developed an analysis tool from first principles for this operation which is being validated through the return maneuvers carried out for the Chandrayaan-3 PM.

"event/Aditya-L1's_ASPEX_instrument_begins_its_measurements","has_description","December 01, 2023 The Aditya Solar wind Particle Experiment (ASPEX) payload onboard India's Aditya-L1 satellite has commenced its operations and is performing normally. ASPEX comprises two cutting-edge instruments – the Solar wind Ion Spectrometer (SWIS) and STEPS (SupraThermal and Energetic Particle Spectrometer). The STEPS instrument was operational on September 10, 2023. The SWIS instrument was activated on November 2, 2023, and has exhibited optimal performance. SWIS, utilizing two sensor units with a remarkable 360° field of view each, operates in planes perpendicular to one another. The instrument has successfully measured solar wind ions, primarily protons and alpha particles. A sample energy histogram acquired from one of the sensors over two days in November 2023 illustrates variations in proton (H+) and alpha particle (doubly ionized helium, He2+) counts. These variations were recorded with nominal integration time, providing a comprehensive snapshot of solar wind behaviour. The directional capabilities of SWIS enable precise measurements of solar wind protons and alphas, contributing significantly to addressing longstanding questions about solar wind properties, underlying processes, and their impact on Earth. The change in the proton and alpha particle number ratio, as observed by SWIS, holds the potential to provide indirect information about the arrival of Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) at the Sun-Earth Lagrange Point L1. Enhanced alpha-to-proton ratio is often regarded as one of the sensitive markers of the passage of interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICMEs) at the L1 and hence considered crucial for space weather studies. As researchers delve deeper into the collected data, the international scientific community eagerly awaits the wealth of knowledge that Aditya-L1's ASPEX is set to unveil about the enigmatic solar wind and its implications for our planet."

The probable impact point was predicted over the North Pacific Ocean. The final ground track did not pass over India. This rocket body (NORAD id 57321) was part of the vehicle that successfully injected the Chandrayaan-3 spacecraft into the intended orbit of 133 km x 35823 km with a 21.3oinclination on July 14, 2023. The re-entry of the rocket body took place within 124 days of its launch. The post-mission orbital lifetime of the LVM3 M4 Cryogenic upper Stage is, thus, fully compliant with the “25-year rule” for LEO (Low Earth Orbit) objects as recommended by the Inter-Agency Space Debris Coordination Committee (IADC). Post Chandrayaan-3 injection, the upper stage had also undergone “passivation” to remove all residual propellant and energy sources to minimise the risks of accidental explosions as per the space debris mitigation guidelines prescribed by the United Nations and IADC. Passivation and Post-mission disposal of this rocket body in adherence to the internationally accepted guidelines once again reaffirms India’s commitment to preserve the long-term sustainability of outer space activities.

"event/First_Crew_Module_for_Gaganyaan_test_flight_takes_shape","has_description","October 06, 2023 Crew Module (CM) is where the astronauts are containedin a pressurized earthlike atmospheric condition during the Gaganyaan mission. The CM for the Gaganyaan mission is in different stages of development. For the Test Vehicle Abort mission-1 (TV-D1), the CM is an unpressurised version that has completed its integration and testing and is ready to be shipped to the launch complex. This unpressurised CM version has to have an overall size and mass of actual Gaganyaan CM. It houses all the systems for the deceleration and recovery. With its complete set of parachutes, recovery aids actuation systems and pyros. The avionics systems in CM are in a dual redundant mode configuration for navigation, sequencing, telemetry, instrumentation and power. The CM in this mission is extensively instrumented to capture the flight data for evaluation of the performance of various systems. The Crew Module will be recovered after touchdown in the Bay of Bengal, using a dedicated vessel and diving team from the Indian Navy. The first development flight Test Vehicle (TV-D1) is in the final stages of preparation. The Test Vehicle is a single-stage liquid rocket developed for this abort mission. The payloads consist of the Crew Module (CM) and Crew Escape Systems (CES) with their fast-acting solid motors, along with CM fairing (CMF) and Interface Adapters. This flight will simulate the abort condition during the ascent trajectory corresponding to a Mach number of 1.2 encountered in the Gaganyaan mission. CES with CMwill be separated from the Test Vehicle at an altitude of about 17 km. Subsequently, the abort sequence will be executed autonomously commencing with the separation of CES and deployment of the series of parachutes, finally culminating in the safe touchdown of CM in the sea, about 10 km from the coast of Sriharikota. The Crew Module after integration underwent various electrical testing, at ISRO’s facility in Bengaluru, including an acoustic test and was dispatched to SDSC-SHAR on 13th August. At SDSC, it will undergo vibration tests and pre-integration with the Crew Escape System, before final integration to the Test Vehicle at the Launch Pad. This Test Vehicle mission with this CM is a significant milestone for the overall Gaganyaan programme as a near-complete system is integrated for a flight test. The success of this test flight will set the stage for the remaining qualification tests and unmanned missions, leading to the first Gaganyaan mission with Indian Astronauts."

"event/CE20_E13_Engine_Hot_Test_for_the_Gaganyaan_&_22t_Thrust_Qualification","has_description","September 25, 2023 ISRO successfully completed the CE20 E13 engine hot test for the Gaganyaan qualification and 22-tonne thrust qualification.  The engine developed by the Liquid Propulsion Systems Centre (LPSC), Valiamala was tested at ISRO Propulsion Complex (IPRC), Mahendragiri on September 22, 2023. The CE20 engine is a vital component, serving as the powerhouse of the Cryogenic Upper Stage (CUS) responsible for propelling the upper stage (C25) of the LVM3 vehicle.  It has demonstrated its capability by successfully operating at a thrust level of 19 tonnes in six successive LVM3 missions, including the Chandrayaan-2, Chandrayaan-3, and two commercial OneWeb missions. To enhance the payload capacity of the LVM3 vehicle, ISRO is upgrading the CE20 engine. The upper cryogenic stage is being transformed into the C32 stage with increased propellant loading capacity, and the engine is being modified to operate at a higher thrust level of 22 tonnes. To ensure the engine's readiness for critical missions, a series of ground hot tests were deemed necessary. The CE20 engine hardware referred to as E13 was selected for both Gaganyaan qualification and 22-tonne thrust level operations. The journey to achieving a 22-tonne thrust capability began with E13 HT-01, a test focused on engine tuning, successfully conducted for a 50-second duration. This initial test set the stage for the upcoming trials. E13 HT-02 marked a significant milestone, conducted on August 30, 2023, with the engine operating flawlessly for an impressive 720 seconds. This test demonstrated the engine's reliability and stability. The third hot test, E13 HT-03, was the pivotal moment in completing the CE20 engine qualification for the Gaganyaan program. On September 22, 2023, this test was conducted at the state-of-the-art test facility located at IPRC, Mahendragiri. During this test, the CE20 engine operated at the coveted 22-tonne thrust level for a duration of 670 seconds. Both the engine and the testing facility performed flawlessly, meeting all the performance parameters. The successful completion of E13 HT-03 signifies the culmination of rigorous testing and the readiness of the CE20 engine for the Gaganyaan program. With all the necessary tests completed, the CE20 engine is now poised for the demanding requirements of the Gaganyaan mission and future endeavours.

"event/An_assessment_of_space_situation_around_Sun-Earth_Lagrange_Point_L1","has_description","ISRO's Aditya-L1 mission, launched on September 2, 2023, is India's first mission dedicated to studying the Sun, specifically the photosphere, chromosphere, and corona of Sun. The spacecraft has commenced its journey to its final destination, the Sun-Earth Lagrange’s Point 1 (L1), on September 18, 2023. Lagrange points, also known as libration points, are unique locations in space where the gravitational force of two massive bodies (like Sun and Earth) precisely equals the centripetal force required for a small object (like spacecraft) to move with them. This makes Lagrange points an excellent location for spacecrafts as orbit corrections and hence fuel requirements, needed to maintain the desired orbit, are kept at a minimum. For any combination of two orbital bodies (like Sun-Earth and Earth-Moon systems), there are five Lagrange points (L1 to L5), all in the orbital plane of the two large bodies (figure-1). The three points - L1, L2, and L3 are dynamically unstable and lie on the line through the centres of the two large bodies, while the remaining two points - L4 and L5 are stable points and each acts as the third vertex of an equilateral triangle formed with the centres of the two large bodies. L1 is particularly significant because it is situated between the two primaries (the Sun and Earth), making it an ideal location for spacecrafts because they allow continuous observation of primary bodies, continuous communication with earth and an unobstructed view of celestial bodies. These orbits are well-suited for scientific missions like Aditya which will act like a solar observatory around L1 and communication to Earth. Aditya-L1 will operate in a ‘Halo orbit’ around the Sun-Earth L1 point, located approximately 1.5 million kilometers from Earth. Halo orbits are periodic, three-dimensional orbits around a Lagrange Point (L1, L2 or L3) and involve an out-of-plane motion component relative to the primary bodies. The orbit is large enough in size to be continuously viewed from Earth and would appear to form a halo around the Lagrange Points (here L1 for Aditya L1). Various past missions have utilized the Sun-Earth L1 point, including the International Sun-Earth Explorer (ISEE-3), the Genesis mission, ESA's LISA Pathfinder, China's Chang'e 5 lunar orbiter, and NASA's Gravity Recovery and Interior Recovery (GRAIL) mission. These missions have contributed to our understanding of space and our ability to monitor space weather events. Several operational spacecrafts are currently stationed at the Sun-Earth L1 point as provided in table-1. These spacecraft at Sun-Earth L1 point provide vital early warnings on adverse space weather events that help protect orbiting space assets and ground based infrastructure. Despite the extremely sparse population in L1 point (figure-2) and the vast separation between them, close approach assessment for an operational spacecraft at Lagrange Point Orbit (LPO) is desirable because of the large positional uncertainty and sensitivity to other perturbative forces. OD (Orbit Determination) for LPO requires tracking data collection over an extended period of time, typically a few days. The typical OD accuracy is of the order of a few km.   For Aditya L1 mission, ISRO plans to carry out such analysis periodically to ensure safety and avoid any possibility of close approaches with other neighbouring spacecrafts, with the support from NASA-JPL."

"event/Workshop_on_Space_Situational_Awareness_&_Space_Traffic_Management_(SSA_&_STM)","has_description","August 14, 2023 Indian Space Research Organisation, ISRO is organising a Workshop on Space Situational Awareness & Space Traffic Management (SSA & STM) meant for Indian students, researchers, and faculty members during October 12-14, 2023 at the ISRO Headquarters in Bengaluru. SSA is the comprehensive knowledge of the Space environment, including the location, orbit, and function of all man-made objects in Space, as well as natural objects / phenomena such as Space weather, asteroids and comets. It is essential for preventing collisions between objects in Space and mitigating the effects of Space debris to support safe, stable and sustainable outer Space activities. STM is the process of ensuring the safe and efficient operation of all Space objects. STM includes the collection and analysis of SSA data, the development of collision avoidance procedures, and the implementation of those procedures. STM is also responsible for the safe disposal of Space debris. SSA and STM are crucial aspects for undertaking Space-related activities by any responsible agency/company/start-up/university, etc. They involve human expertise and dedicated observational facilities such as radars, telescopes, and Space-based platforms for precise orbital information of Space objects and guidelines, both at national and international levels. ISRO has established “ISRO System for Safe and Sustainable Space Operations Management (IS4OM)” to provide services for safeguarding Indian Space assets. While encouraging the involvement of private players in the Space sector, ISRO recognises the importance of generating expertise in these domains that in turn not only creates career opportunities but also ensures making Space a safer, more stable, and sustainable environment for future endeavours and hence this workshop is organised. The workshop will have expert technical talks from eminent ISRO scientists and interactive sessions with top-level scientists and engineers from various ISRO Centres.

"event/ISRO_Conducts_Drogue_Parachute_Deployment_Tests_for_Gaganyaan_Mission","has_description","August 11, 2023 Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre (VSSC)/ISRO, successfully conducted a series of Drogue Parachute Deployment Tests at the Rail Track Rocket Sled (RTRS) facility of the Terminal Ballistics Research Laboratory, Chandigarh, during August 8-10, 2023. The tests were conducted in collaboration with Aerial Delivery Research and Development Establishment (ADRDE)/DRDO. The Gaganyaan mission entails the safe transportation of astronauts to space and back. A crucial component of this mission is the deployment of drogue parachutes, which play a pivotal role in stabilizing the crew module and reducing its velocity to a safe level during re-entry. Drogue parachutes, packed within pyro-based devices known as mortars, are ingeniously designed to eject the parachutes into the air upon command. These conical ribbon-type parachutes, boasting a diameter of 5.8 meters, employ a single-stage reefing mechanism, ingeniously minimizing canopy area and mitigating opening shock, ensuring a smooth and controlled descent. During the three comprehensive tests conducted at the RTRS facility, a range of real-world scenarios were simulated to rigorously evaluate the performance and reliability of the drogue parachutes. The first test simulated the maximum reefed load, marking a groundbreaking introduction of reefing in a mortar-deployed parachute within India. The second test emulated the maximum disreefed load, while the third test showcased the deployment of the drogue parachute under conditions mirroring the maximum angle of attack experienced by the Crew Module during its mission. These successful RTRS tests serve as a critical qualification milestone for the drogue parachutes, confirming their readiness for integration into the upcoming Test Vehicle-D1 mission. Notably, earlier this year, the RTRS tests of Pilot and Apex cover separation parachutes were also conducted, further accentuating the progress of the Gaganyaan mission's parachute system development. The intricate parachute sequence for the Gaganyaan crew module's deceleration system encompasses a total of 10 parachutes. The sequence commences with the deployment of two Apex cover separation parachutes, followed by the stabilization achieved through the deployment of two drogue parachutes. Upon release of the drogue parachutes, the mission transitions into the extraction phase, with three Pilot chutes individually extracting three main parachutes, a pivotal step in reducing the Crew Module's speed to safe levels for a secure landing."

"event/Current_Space_Situation_around_the_Moon_–_An_assessment","has_description","Current Space Situation around the Moon – An assessmentHome/Current Space Situation around the Moon – An assessment Aug 08, 2023 Introduction Exploration of space beyond the near-Earth regime has been one of the most challenging and fascinating ventures of humankind and continues to capture the imagination of generations. Over the ages, several space-faring nations have undertaken numerous missions to explore most of the planets in the solar system, their natural moons, various minor planets/ asteroids, comets and even interplanetary voyages. The Moon and Mars are the most explored and also comparatively more crowded planetary bodies at present. India’s Chandryaan-3 (CH3) is the latest entry into the lunar orbit. More intensified activities around the Moon are foreseen in the next few years due to the renewed interest in lunar exploration, heralded by Artemis missions for return to the Moon and preparations for colonisation of Mars. While the previous missions were essentially aimed at scientific explorations, upcoming ventures will likely involve multiple actors of diverse interests, including those primarily driven by resource utilisation for commercial purposes. A better understanding of theenvironment is needed to formulate reasonable mitigation practices to avoid close-approach threats in planetary orbits. The current Space Debris Mitigation Guidelines by the UN and Inter-Agency Space Debris Coordination Committee (IADC) are applicable to spacecraft and orbital stages “that will be injected into Earth orbit.Currently space debris pose a major threat to the long-term sustainability of outer space activities in the ever-increasingly congested Earth orbits. Therefore, based on the lessons learnt while operating in the near-Earth regime, it is interesting and desirable to undertake studies related to close approaches in view of the increasing number of objects in the lunar orbits. Tracking of deep space objects Observation and tracking of deep space objects are inherently more complex compared to that in the near-Earth regime, mainly due to the vast distance involved between the object and the observer which introduces considerable latency, signal attenuation and associated complexities. Functional assets like spacecraft/landers/rovers are tracked by active and passive means. Typical active techniques involve range and Doppler measurement, very long baseline interferometry (VLBI)/Delta Differential One-way Ranging (DOR), and laser ranging with retro-reflectors. Optical transponders have also been demonstrated for missions like the Messenger, Mars Global Surveyor, and Hyabusa-2 which can give better accuracy. Lunar orbits Orbital evolution in lunar orbit is primarily influenced by lunar gravity, gravity of the Sun and the Earth, and the Sun Radiation Pressure. For orbits lower than 500 km, non-uniformity of lunar gravity due to mass concentrations dominates, which along with the third body perturbations due to the Earth and the Sun causes the orbit eccentricity (without any change in the semi-major axis) to increase. As a result, the perilune altitude is gradually lowered leading to eventual impact with the lunar surface. For example, the expected orbital lifetime of a spacecraft at a 100 km circular orbit is about 160 days. The major types of lunar orbitsinclude Halo orbit around Langrange’s point, Nearly Rectilinear Halo Orbit (NRHO), Low Lunar Orbit (LLO), and Distant Retrograde Orbit (DRO). NRHO orbits offer the advantages of being stable and requiring less orbit maintenance, maintaining continuous communication with Earth and other lunar orbiting crafts, eclipse avoidance etc. and are highly suitable to host lunar gateways. Several forthcoming missions may also be placed in similar orbits, but given the vast spatial extent of such orbits (far larger than the GEO belt), no congestion is anticipated in the foreseeable future. Majorityof the currentlyorbiting lunar probes operate in LLO. The current situation around the moon As of July 2023, there are 6 active lunar orbiters (see Fig-1). Two of the five probes of NASA’s THEMIS mission have been re-purposed under ARTEMIS (Acceleration, Reconnection, Turbulence and Electrodynamics of the Moon's Interaction with the Sun) as ARTEMIS P1 and ARTEMIS P2, both operate in eccentric orbits of low inclination. NASA’s Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) orbits the Moon in a nearly polar, slightly elliptical orbit. Chandrayaan-2, the second lunar mission of ISRO and Korea Pathfinder Lunar Orbiter (KPLO) also operate in polar orbits of 100 km altitude. NASA’s Capstone operates in a 9:2 resonant southern L2 NRHO, its perilune passes over the lunar North pole at 1500-1600 km altitude, while the apolune is over the South pole at  a distance of nearly 70,000 km. The Japanese spacecraft Ouna which was placed in lunar orbit as part of Kaguya/SELENE mission in 2009 and Chandrayaan-1 launched in 2008 are the two defunct spacecraft. All the other orbiters have been either moved out of the moon-bound orbital regime or have landed/impacted the lunar surface, either deliberately or due to failure to land softly. For example, Chang’e 4 mission’s data relay satellite Queqiao, launched by China in May 2018, was later moved to a halo orbit near the Earth-Moon L2 point. Currently, the only operating rover is China’s Yutu-2 rover released by Chang’e 4, which operates on the far side. From the available media sources, it is expected that Luna-25 of Russia with a Lander and Rover will be in Lunar orbit of 100 km by August 16, 2023 and will be landing on South pole of the moon by August 21-23, 2023.

Sometimes such conjunctions even warrant collision avoidance manoeuvres to be executed to be on the safer side because of the uncertainty associated with orbital estimates. Till July 2023, Chandrayan-2 has performed 3 collision avoidance manoeuvres to mitigate critical close approaches with LRO and KPLO. It is noteworthy that effective coordination is taking place among the agencies to avoid critical conjunctions in the Lunar orbit. For Chandryaan-3 (CH3) mission, the propulsion module is expected to orbit around the moon in a circular LLO of about 150 km altitude for many years to come. Majority of the lunar landers are also likely to temporarily reside in LLO (typically for a few days or weeks) before landing. Under the ambit of ISRO System for Safe and Sustainable Space Operations Management (IS4OM) critical analyses of each of the Lunar Bound Manoeuvres for orbit loweringare being performed to assess potential risks of close approaches with the other lunar orbiters before executing the manoeuvres. Role of India and way forward The space object population has been growing for space beyond the Earth as well as in the lunar environment, where the greater uncertainty associated with the orbital knowledge entailscollision risk assessment to be a necessity for safe operations for a spacecraft orbiting the Moon. India has pro-actively taken up many initiatives in collaboration with International Organisations like Inter Agency Space Debris Coordination Committee (IADC), which include studies related to future evolution of space object environment in cislunar and lunar region to bring out specific guidelines and best practices for space operations to be sustainable in these regions."

"event/De-orbiting_PS4_stage_in_PSLV-C56_Mission","has_description","August 05, 2023 PSLV-C56 vehicle successfully injected DS-SAR and 6 other satellites into their intended 536 km circular Low Earth Orbit (LEO) with a 5-degree inclination on July 30, 2023. The vehicle achieved the precise target orbit conditions in 20 minutes after lift-off using the Onboard Navigation, Guidance and Control system and completed its mission. Left alone in a 536 km circular orbit, the PS4 stage would orbit the Earth for over 25 years. As the number of satellites in LEO is growing and the space around this orbit is of particular interest, the orbit of the spent PS4 stage was reduced to 300 km circular. In line with India's commitment to supporting worldwide space debris mitigation efforts, the Onboard Guidance Algorithm was modified to achieve this orbit-change manuevre. The Orbit Change Thrusters (low thrust engines) were fired twice for orbit change. Furthermore, in line with standard launch practices, the PS4 Stage was passivated after the re-orbiting process, as no further active propulsion need was anticipated. This passivation involved venting of all pressurized compartments (Tanks/Gas bottles) to release any stored energy or potential hazardous substances. By mitigating the possibility of pressurized compartment failures, the chance of fragmentation of the spent stage in orbit is minimized, thereby further reducing the creation of space debris."

(ESRI) for the year 2023. ESRI is the global market leader in geographic information system (GIS) software, location intelligence, and mapping. The institute presents the SAG award annually to recognize exceptional work in the field of GIS technology. During the plenary session of the ESRI User Conference held on July 10, 2023, in California, Mr. Jack Dangermond, the president and founder of ESRI, selected and announced the recipients of this year's SAG awards. NRSC emerged as the awardee from India, setting a new precedent within the GIS community for its outstanding application of GIS technology in landslide inventory. NRSC is recognised for their feat of creating a comprehensive geospatial database consisting of approximately 80,000 landslides in India spanning from 1998 to 2022, utilizing satellite data. This landslide inventory database was augmented with vital information such as lithology, geological structure, soil composition, slope analysis, and land use patterns. Leveraging advanced machine learning techniques, NRSC developed landslide susceptibility maps for critical tourist corridors in Himachal Pradesh and pilgrimage road corridors in Uttarakhand, both located in the Indian Himalayan region. Given the severe impact of landslides, which exhibit a life cycle of 3-4 years, monitoring their kinetic behaviour, particularly in the tertiary stage, becomes crucial for predicting the time of failure. The geospatial landslide inventory database of India, covering the Himalayas and Western Ghats regions, has served as a fundamental resource for landslide mitigation studies. Additionally, this comprehensive database has provided crucial insights into the factors influencing landslides in India. The landslide susceptibility maps are potentially instrumental for decision-makers in planning developmental activities in hilly regions, ensuring the safety and welfare of local communities. NRSC's novel work in estimating landslide kinematics using Persistent Scatterer Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (PSInSAR) technology has further enhanced their capabilities in predicting vulnerable slope failures in hilly terrains. By employing PSInSAR, NRSC has contributed to the advancement of landslide research and improved disaster preparedness measures.

The test was conducted towards developing a 2000 kN thrust semi-cryogenic engine to power the booster stages of future launch vehicles. The objective of the test was to validate the integrated performance of the critical subsystems such as the gas generator, turbo pumps, pre-burner and control components by carrying out a hot-firing for a short-duration of 4.5 s. The ignition and generation of hot-gas within the pre-burner chamber that drives the main turbine to drive the fuel and oxidiser pumps, was focussed. The test proceeded as predicted till 1.9 s validating the ignition and subsequent performance of PHTA. At 2.0 s,  an unanticipated spike in the turbine pressure and subsequent loss of turbine-speed was observed. As a precautionary step, the test was terminated. Analysis under progress would offer further understanding before proceeding with further hot-tests for longer duration. The semi-cryogenic engine utilizes a propellant combination of Liquid Oxygen (LOX) and Kerosene, and the power head test article forms the first hardware test of the engine development program. The test was carried out the dedicated test facility recently established at IPRC for testing semi-cryogenic engines and stages.

"event/Scientists_Discover_an_extreme_Massive_Giant_and_Most_Dense_Exoplanet","has_description","May 26, 2023 A new Jupiter size exoplanet with highest density of ~14 g/cm3known till this date, and mass 13 times that of Jupiter has been discovered by an international team of scientists led by Prof. Abhijit Chakraborty at the Exoplanet Research Group of the Physical Research Laboratory (PRL), Ahmedabad. The team includes scientists from India, Germany, Switzerland and the USA. The discovery of this massive exoplanet was made using the indigenously made PRL Advanced Radial-velocity Abu-sky Search spectrograph (PARAS) at the 1.2 m telescope of PRL at its Gurushikhar Observatory in Mt. Abu by measuring the mass of the planet precisely. The newly discovered exoplanet is found around the star called TOI4603 or HD 245134. NASA’s The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) initially declared TOI4603 as a possible candidate to host a secondary body of unknown nature. Using PARAS, scientists discovered it as a planet by measuring the mass of the secondary body and hence the planet is called TOI 4603b or HD 245134b. It is located 731 light years away. It orbits a sub-giant F-type star TOI4603 every 7.24 days. What sets this discovery apart is  that the planet falls into the transition mass range of massive giant planets and low-mass brown dwarfs with masses ranging from 11 to 16 times the mass of Jupiter. Only fewer than five exoplanets are currently known in this mass range so far. Massive giant exoplanets are those having mass greater than four times that of Jupiter.  The newly discovered exoplanet TOI 4603b is one of the most massive and densest giant planets that orbits very close to its host star at a distance less than 1/10th the distance between our Sun and Earth.  The exoplanet with a surface temperature of 1670 K is likely undergoing high-eccentricity tidal migration with an eccentricity value of approximately 0.3 The detection of such systems provides valuable insights into the formation, migration, and evolution mechanisms of massive exoplanets. This discovery marks the third exoplanet discovery by India, and by the PRL scientists using PARAS  spectrograph and the PRL 1.2m telescope, following the discoveries in 2018 (K2-236b) and 2021 (TOI-1789b). The findings of this study is published in the journal Astronomy & Astrophysics Letters. The publication titled ""Discovery of a massive giant planet with extreme density around the sub-giant star TOI-4603."" provides details of the discovery and a comprehensive account of exoplanet's characteristics.Click hereto access the publication.

Comparing two                                     photographs taken on May 19, 2020 and May 22, 2023. Renowned amateur astronomer Mr. Koichi Itagaki discovered SN2023ixf on May 19, 2023.                                     This remarkable celestial event, classified as a Type-II supernova, is located in                                     the Pinwheel Galaxy (M101), approximately 21 million light years away from Earth.                                     Supernovae are awe-inspiring phenomena that result from the explosive death of                                     massive stars.What's truly remarkable about the photograph by the amateur astronomers from ISRO is                                     that the team captured this celestial event using a Nikon Z6 ii camera equipped with                                     a Samyang 135 mm lens at f2.8 and ISO 1000, along with the iOptronSkyGuider pro as                                     their sky tracking device. This simple setup allowed them to record the supernova's                                     evolving appearance in the night sky.The image processing techniques employed by the team involved stacking multiple                                     frames to enhance the details of SN2023ixf. On May 22, 2023, they stacked 107 light                                     frames of 20 seconds each, totaling 35 minutes of exposure time (shot at 135 mm and                                     cropped). Similarly, May 19, 2020 photo was stacked from 107 light frames of 25                                     seconds each, totaling 45 minutes of exposure time (shot at 300 mm).The passion, dedication, and ingenuity of amateur astronomers demonstrating that                                     some rare celestial events can be observed and captured even with basic equipment,                                     given the right skills and determination is praiseworthy. The wonders of the                                     universe are within reach for those who dare to explore and observe."

The satellite carrying 12 extended C band transponders was launched on  July 15, 2011. It was located at 83° E longitude till March 2021. After the launch of its replacement satellite CMS-01 in 2020, it was later relocated to 47.96° E longitude. The satellite served for more than a decade. The Geosynchronous Earth Orbital regime is one of the most populated and highly utilised regions. Internationally accepted space debris mitigation guidelines by the UN and IADC recommend disposing of an object away from the GEO region at its end-of-life. The recommended practice is to re-orbit the object to a nearly circular  “graveyard” orbit sufficiently above the GEO region so that the orbit would not decay back into the GEO-protected zone under the influence of perturbation forces, such as non-uniformity of Earth shape, Sun’s Moon’s gravity, solar radiation pressure, etc., within another 100 years. Hence, the final disposal orbit must meet specific criteria on the minimum raise in perigee altitude depending on the object's reflectivity, mass, shape, and size. The graveyard orbit also needs to be nearly circular (very low orbital eccentricity, less than or equal to 0.003). For GSAT-12, the required minimum raise in perigee altitude was estimated to be 261 km. As a result of meticulous operations management by the Master Control Facility (MCF), the available fuel of GSAT-12 was more than sufficient to meet this goal.  A series of seven manoeuvres were carried out to raise the orbit above the GEO altitude of 35786 km. The first manoeuvre on  March 16, 2023, was a shorter burn to circularize the orbit, followed by another six burns, typically of 150 seconds duration. These burns were performed alternately at the perigee and apogee points, 12 hours apart, to raise the respective altitude in steps of approximately 116 km. This strategy ensured that the intermediate orbits also remained almost circular. After completing the seventh burn on 19th March 19, the satellite reached a super-synchronous circular orbit of nearly 400 km above the GEO altitude. Space Debris Mitigation guidelines also recommend passivation/removing all energy sources, fluidic and electrical, to minimise the risk of any post-mission accidental break-up. Four inclination changing manoeuvres of GSAT-12 were carried out during March 20-22 to spend the remaining propellant. To deal with the growing uncertainty in the exact availability of fuel near depletion, this inclination-changing strategy helped avoid any disruption in the circularity of the already achieved graveyard orbit.  On March 23, the final passivation manoeuvre was carried out to vent out the remaining fuel by firing the oppositely mounted thrusters, cancelling the net thrust without affecting the orbit. As part of electrical passivation, all rotating mechanisms such as the momentum wheels, reaction wheels and gyros were turned off, batteries were disconnected from the solar panels and discharged. Finally, the transmitters were switched off to avoid any potential RF interference. The passivation activities were completed on March 23, 2023. All operations were conducted by MCF, Hassan, in coordination with U R Rao Satellite Centre, SATCOM Programme Office, and IS4OM (ISRO System for Safe and Sustainable Space Operations Management). The manoeuvre plans were screened to rule out any possibility of post-manoeuvre conjunction with any neighbouring space objects.  In addition to RF interference analysis during the planning phase, the necessary coordination with the external satellite operators was carried out to avoid any interference issues during the westward migration of the satellite from its fixed longitude slot as it no longer remained geosynchronous with progressive altitude raise. GSAT-12 is the 23rd GEO satellite to undergo PMD before decommissioning. The finally achieved circular orbit was nearly 400 km above the GEO altitude. The PMD operation is fully compliant with the IADC and UN space debris mitigation guidelines as well as the UN guidelines for the long-term sustainability of outer space activities."

"event/Chandrayaan-3_Data_Analysis_Workshop_for_National_Academia_and_Institutes","has_description","April 3, 2023 ISRO organized a two-day workshop on the Science and Data Analysis aspects of the forthcoming Chandrayaan-3 mission, during March 28-29, 2023, at the Indian Space Science Data Centre (ISSDC), Byalalu, near Bangalore. The Workshop comprised lectures on the Indian lunar exploration programme, setting the context for the Chandrayaan-3 mission, data archival and dissemination aspects, and the scientific experiments on Chandrayaan-3.  Extensive hands-on training on the processing and analyzing the laboratory data of the Chandrayaan-3 payloads, and a dedicated interaction session between the participants from the academia and institutes with the scientists from ISRO/DOS were the major focus of the workshop. The workshop was attended by 50 participants from outside the Department of Space, which included 24 faculty members and senior students from Universities and Institutes who would use the lunar data.  A total number of 33 Indian academic institutes outside DOS were represented in the workshop.  Around 20 scientists from ISRO/ DOS gave presentations on science payloads and conducted the hands-on sessions. Shri A S Kiran Kumar, former Chairman, ISRO / Secretary, DOS graced the inaugural programme and wished the gathering for the success of the workshop. He emphasized the importance of carrying forward the legacy of the space science exploration programme to the students. Shri B N Ramakrishna, Director, ISTRAC presided over the inaugural session and appraised the gathering about the importance of the mission, and the wealth of scientific data from the Indian scientific missions, hosted in ISSDC, which are open to the scientific community for use. Dr. Tirtha Pratim Das, Director, Space Science Programme Office, ISRO Headquarters delivered a lecture on the scientific rationale to study the Moon, and how would the Chandrayaan-3 mission fit in the bigger picture of understanding the solar system. Chandrayaan-3 mission carries scientific instruments to study the thermo-physical properties of the lunar regolith, lunar seismicity, lunar surface plasma environment and elemental composition in the vicinity of the landing site. While the scope of these scientific instruments on the lander and the rover would fit in the theme of'Science of the Moon', another experimental instrument will study the spectro-polarimetric signatures of the Earth from the lunar orbit, which would fit in the theme of'Science from the Moon'. The students got introductory training on how to analyze in-situ data and will be using the data analysis manual for further preparedness for analysing Chandrayaan-3 data.  It was mentioned that thein-situmeasurements from Chandrayaan-3 would complement some of the remote sensing measurements by the Chandrayaan-2 orbiter by providing the ground truth.  The workshop concluded with a feedback session wherein the participants appreciated ISRO/ DOS for conducting such workshops."

"event/Indian_Space_Situational_Assessment_for_the_year_2022_–_Highlights","has_description","April 3, 2023 Shri S. Somanath, Secretary DOS/Chairman ISRO, released the Indian Space Situational Assessment                       Report (ISSAR) for 2022 in March 2023. The report is compiled by ISRO System for Safe &                       Sustainable Operations Management (IS4OM) Spaceassets are vital for the social and economic development of a nation. They                     play a crucial role in national security and defense. Rapid technological advancement and                     diversification of space activities have led to a growing number of space objects. The current space                     object population consists of more than 7000 operational satellites orbiting the Earth at different                     altitudes with millions of pieces of space debris. The space environmental risks to space assets                     arise due to space debris. Due to the enormousspeed, a collision with even a centimeter-sized object                     can cause a space asset's catastrophic failure, leading to mission closure. Therefore, continual                     awareness of the space environment and its future evolution, namely Space Situational Awareness                     (SSA), is a prerequisite for safe and sustainable operations in space. As a responsible space-faring                     nation, India follows the guidelines recommended by the UN and IADC in its space activities. It                     complies with them to the best possible and practicable extent. India's national space agency, ISRO,                     monitors the ever-evolving, highly dynamic space environment to protect Indian space assets and                     annually assesses the prevailing space situation for reference and planning. The Indian Space                     Situational Assessment Report (ISSAR) for 2022 is compiled by ISRO System for Safe & Sustainable                     Operations Management (IS4OM). Highlights of the report are as follows. Highlights of the space situational assessment for the year                         2022: Global ScenarioIn 2022, the space object population grew,indicating easy accessibility to space and                     increasingdiverse applications of space technology. In 2022, more space objects were placed in orbit                     per launch compared to the previous year. Total of 2533 objects from 179 launches in 2022 against                     1860 objects from 135 launches in 2021. A 32% increase in successful launches anda 36% increase in                     the number of objects inserted in orbit were witnessed. Four major on-orbit break-up events added                     over 360 fragmented objects to the space debris population. Indian ScenarioTill 2022, a total of 124 Indian satellites, including those from private operators/academic                     institutions,have beenlaunched. As of January 1, 2023, the government owns 23 and 29 operational                     satellites in LEO and GEO, respectively. Chandrayaan-2 Orbiter is active in lunar orbit. During the                     year, 13 satellites re-entered the atmosphere.The rocket body (uppermost stage of a launch vehicle)                     of the PSLV-C8/Advance Avionics Module (launched on April 23, 2007) re-entered the Earth on July19,                     2022. At the end of 2022, of 69 rocket bodies from Indian launches, 45 are still orbiting. Sixty-one                     fragments of the PS4stageof PSLV-C3 (launched on October 22, 2001, fragmented in space on December                     19, 2001) are orbiting in space (spacetrack.org).There were four successful launches by ISRO in 2022 (Table-1). A total of eight Indian satellites                     and four rocket bodies were placed in orbit. Indian communication satellite CMS-02 was launched from                     French Guiana by an Ariane launch vehicle. SSLV-D1 could not place any object in orbit. Table-1: List of successful launches by India and the payloads put into orbit Close approach risk mitigation for Indian space assets in 2022 Space Object Proximity Analysis (SOPA) for SatellitesISRO regularly analyses to predict close approaches of other space objects to Indian space assets.                     In 2022,in-house SOPA generated about 14000 alerts for the close approaches within 1                     km.Additionally, about 13000 close approach alerts were received from US Space Command USSPACECOM.                     The latter were re-assessed using more accurate orbital data of the Indian operational satellites.                     Critical close approaches require a Collision Avoidance Maneuver (CAM) to safeguard the operational                     spacecraft.A total of 22 CAMs were executed in 2022, including one for the lunar orbit (Table-2).                     Figure 1 shows the CAMs executed over the years. The plot indicates increasing congestion in outer                     space. Table-2: Collision Avoidance Maneuver in 2022 Figure 1. Number of CAMS executed over the years Regular Orbit Maneuvers (OM)are executed for ISRO satellites to maintain                     themwithin the specified orbits. SOPA outcomes were utilized to avoid any close approach of the                     satellite undergoing regular OM with neighboring space objects immediately after the maneuver. Table-3: Regular Orbit Maneuvers (OM)executed for ISRO satellitesin 2022, excluding CAMs Collision Avoidance (COLA) Analyses for Launch VehiclesCOLA analyses for lift-off clearance of launch vehicles were carried out as part of the mandatory                     Launch Clearance Protocol of ISRO launch vehicles. The nominal lift-off of PSLV-C53was deferred by 2                     minutes based on the COLA analysis to avoid potentialclose conjunctions within 5 km with COSMOS 2251                     debris (NORAD id 35891), ICEYE-X6 satellite (NORAD id 46497) and a few Starlink satellites 3787,                     2701, 2090, during the ascent phase of the launch vehicle and the initial orbital phase of the                     satellites. The requisite coordination with the operators of the functional satellites was ensured                     for spaceflight safety. As no close-approach risks were detected, the nominal lift-off timings were                     cleared for other launches (PSLVC52, PSLV-C54 & LVM3-M2). Figure 2. ""Black-out"" zones within the PSLV-C53 launch window, over which the lift-off is                       prohibited to avoid close approach risk with other space objects. Spacecraft Decommissioning and Post Mission DisposalINSAT-4B (launched on March 11, 2007) was decommissioned on January 24, 2022, after being raised to                     a super synchronous orbit, a graveyard, anda disposal orbit band. Disposal orbit achieved complies                     with the IADC guidelines on post-mission disposal of GEO objects                     (More details). RISAT-2 (launched on April 20, 2009) was operational till September 2022 at an                     altitude of 350 km. The spacecraft re-entered Earth's atmosphere on October 30, 2022                     (More details). The planned de-orbiting of a spacecraft is a major highlight of 2022.                     Meghatropiques-1 satellite (MT1) (launched on October 12, 2011)was de-orbited with a series of                     maneuversduring August-December 2022. In August, the satellite was operational in a 20° inclined                     orbit at 867 km altitude, where its post-mission lifetime would have been more than 100 years. The                     orbital lifetime was reduced to less than 25 years by the September end and to less than a few                     months by the end of December. The satellite underwent a controlled re-entry over the South Pacific                     Ocean onMarch 7, 2023 (More details). Mars Orbiter Mission (MOM) (launched on November 5, 2023) was operational for                     about eight years. The spacecraft lost communication with the ground station after experiencing a                     long eclipse in April 2022. As all the attempts to re-establish communication with the spacecraft                     were unsuccessful, MOM was declared non-operational                     (More details). Way forwardThe year 2022 witnessed the maximum number of on-orbit payload deployments reflecting the growing                     interest in space activities by emergent entities, particularly private sectors. The number of close                     approach alerts received, and the number of CAMs performed by ISRO also increased. This trend is                     expected to continue. The associated penalties for CAM, such as fuel expenditure, disruption of                     payload operations, operational overheads, and frequent coordination with external operators, are                     also anticipated to increase. As of today,a universally accepted Space Traffic Management (STM)                     framework is nonexistent. Hence, resolving multiple conjunctions between operational satellites is                     expected to add operational complexities in the future. As a part of ISRO's holistic approach towards safe and sustainable utilization                     of outer space for national development, ISRO System for Safe & Sustainable Operations                     Management (IS4OM),dedicated to the nation by the Honourable Minister of State, Dr. Jitendra Singh                     in 2022, aims to safeguard ISRO's space assets and to improve compliance with internationally                     recognized guidelines on the long-term sustainability of outer space activities. IS4OM is mandated                     to carry out Space Situational Awareness and Space Traffic Management activities covering                     observation and monitoring of space objects and space environment, processing the observations for                     orbit determination, object characterization and cataloging, modeling the evolution of space                     environment, potential threat detection, risk assessment and mitigation, data exchange, and                     collaboration. Participation of private industries and academia is expected soon tounlock                     India's full potential in the Space sector. All space-faring entities are aware of the potentially                     detrimental effects of space debris and adhere to space debris mitigation guidelines and best                     practices. It is essential to augment and expand the network of observational facilities for                     heightened awareness of the space situation. Establishing a space surveillance and tracking network                     with RADARS and Optical Telescopes is currently undertakenby the project Network for Space Objects                     Tracking and Analysis (NETRA) by ISRO. Complete coverage of the space objects distributed over                     various orbital regimes requires a wide network of observational facilities with a geographically                     diverse distribution. As space-based activities have potential global implications, international                     collaboration ensures preserving the near-Earth space environment for continued exploration and                     utilization by future generations of humankind."

"event/ISRO_successfully_conducts_the_Reusable_Launch_Vehicle_Autonomous_Landing_Mission_(RLV_LEX)","has_description","April 02, 2023 ISRO successfully conducted the Reusable Launch Vehicle Autonomous Landing Mission (RLV LEX). The test was conducted at the Aeronautical Test Range (ATR), Chitradurga, Karnataka in the early hours on April 2, 2023. The RLV took off at 7:10 am IST by a Chinook Helicopter of the Indian Air Force as an underslung load and flew to a height of 4.5 km (above MSL). Once the predetermined pillbox parameters were attained, based on the RLV's Mission Management Computer command, the RLV was released in mid-air, at a down range of 4.6 km. Release conditions included 10 parameters covering position, velocity, altitude and body rates, etc. The release of RLV was autonomous. RLV then performed approach and landing maneuvers using the Integrated Navigation, Guidance & control system and completed an autonomous landing on the ATR air strip at 7:40 AM IST. With that, ISRO successfully achieved the autonomous landing of a space vehicle. The autonomous landing was carried out under the exact conditions of a Space Re-entry vehicle's landing ""high speed, unmanned, precise landing from the same return path"" as if the vehicle arrives from space. Landing parameters such as Ground relative velocity, the sink rate of Landing Gears, and precise body rates, as might be experienced by an orbital re-entry space vehicle in its return path, were achieved. The RLV LEX demanded several state-of-the-art technologies including accurate Navigation hardware and software, Pseudolite system, Ka-band Radar Altimeter, NavIC receiver, indigenous Landing Gear, Aerofoil honey-comb fins and brake parachute system. In a first in the world, a winged body has been carried to an altitude of 4.5 km by a helicopter and released for carrying out an autonomous landing on a runway. RLV is essentially a space plane with a low lift to drag ratio requiring an approach at high glide angles that necessitated a landing at high velocities of 350 kmph. LEX utilized several indigenous systems. Localized Navigation systems based on pseudolite systems, instrumentation, and sensor systems, etc. were developed by ISRO. Digital Elevation Model (DEM) of the landing site with a Ka-band Radar Altimeter provided accurate altitude information. Extensive wind tunnel tests and CFD simulations enabled aerodynamic characterization of RLV prior to the flight. Adaptation of contemporary technologies developed for RLV LEX turns other operational launch vehicles of ISRO more cost-effective. ISRO had demonstrated the re-entry of its winged vehicle RLV-TD in the HEX mission in May 2016. The re-entry of a hypersonic sub-orbital vehicle marked a major accomplishment in developing Reusable Launch Vehicles. In HEX, the vehicle landed on a hypothetical runway over the Bay of Bengal. Precise landing on a runway was an aspect not included in the HEX mission. The LEX mission achieved the final approach phase that coincided with the re-entry return flight path exhibiting an autonomous, high speed (350 kmph) landing. The LEX began with an Integrated Navigation test in 2019 and followed multiple Engineering Model Trials and Captive Phase tests in subsequent years. Along with ISRO, IAF, CEMILAC, ADE, and ADRDE contributed to this test. The IAF team hand in hand with the Project team and multiple sorties were conducted to perfect the achievement of release conditions. Dr. S Unnikrishnan Nair, Director, VSSC, and Shri Shyam Mohan N, Programme Director, ATSP guided the teams. Dr. Jayakumar M, Project Director, RLV was the Mission Director, and Shri Muthupandian J, Associate Project Director, RLV was the Vehicle Director for the mission. Shri Ramakrishna, Director, ISTRAC was present on the occasion.  Chairman, ISRO/Secretary, DOS Shri S Somanath witnessed the test and congratulated the team. With LEX, the dream of an Indian Reusable Launch Vehicle arrives one step closer to reality.

"event/IRS_1A_was_launched_this_day_(March_17)_in__1988","has_description","Indian Remote Sensing Satellite, IRS-1AHome Mar 17, 2023 Indian Remote Sensing Satellite, IRS-1A A forerunner for operational eraK Kasturirangan and V Jayaraman BACKGROUND The Indo-USSR cooperation is undoubtedly one of the best examples of international cooperation in Space. For India, this collaboration played a catalytic role in the early years of building capability in satellite technology and greatly assisted in accelerating the Indian efforts of using space technology for national development. These cooperative efforts essentially got a boost with India signing an agreement with the Academy of Sciences of the USSR on 10th May 1972. USSR assigned the practical implementation of the Agreement to DB Yuzhnoye, under its Interkosmos programme of doing joint research with other countries. The agreement culminated in the successful launch of India’s first satellite, ARYABHATA, on 19th April 1975 by a Soviet rocket carrier Interkosmos from Kapustin Yar cosmodrome. ARYABHATA was followed by launching by USSR of two experimental earth observation satellites, BHASKARA-1 & 2 in 1979 and 1981 respectively from Kapustin Yar. In addition to the free launch, USSR supplied the reaction control system, solar panels, thermal paints, chemical battery and tape recorders, besides providing TTC support from the Bears Lake station near Moscow. BHASKARA missions provided valuable experience in a number of inter-related disciplines of space-based remote sensing system for resource survey and management such as understanding how to configure, design and qualify a remote sensing platform and to devise a compatible ground segment for data collection and in-orbit mission management as well as demonstrating the methodologies for using remote sensing technology for specific applications. Thus, the genesis of the Indian Remote Sensing Satellite-1A (IRS-1A) can be traced to BHASKARA 1&2 and various initiatives taken during the period around them. The long term planning of Indian Space programme itself had envisaged the realisation of an operational capability in remote sensing using space-based platforms as one of the high priority items. As a part of evolving this strategy, ISRO had conducted in 1970s a number of aerial flights, developed a variety of sensors, ground-based data processing and interpretation hardware & software as well as carrying out a number of demonstration studies. Data from the American LANDSAT 1& 2 satellites launched in 1972 and 1975 were also used in a number of demonstration studies, more regularly so once a data reception from these satellites were formalised at NRSA in 1979. This was around this time that the framework for Indian Remote Sensing satellite was conceived and conceptualised. ISRO realised the importance of involving the end-users right from the beginning of the planning process. With this in view the Joint Experiment Programme (JEP) was taken up in 1978 in association with user Ministries. It was yet another significant step along with the successful completion of experimental BHASKARA missions that aimed at laying a foundation for an Indian Remote Sensing Satellite. Further, early 80s also saw the emergence of the unique institutional strategy, namely the National Natural Resources Management System (NNRMS), wherein the traditional techniques as well as the remote sensing technology were integrated to provide timely, accurate and specific information on natural resources to decision makers at various levels. As a part of preparatory activities of NNRMS, around 60 well-defined experiments to demonstrate the utilisation of remote sensing in various application areas were conducted. NNRMS itself came into being through a national conference held in May 1983 with the participation of various Ministries and the Planning Commission, with Department of Space identified as the nodal agency. Mid-80s also saw feverish activities around the country in establishing facilities in many States as well as developing educational courses towards capacity building in anticipation of the Indian Remote Sensing Satellite programme. As a pre-investment to the proposed launch of IRS-1A, an IRS Utilisation Programme (IRS-UP) was also launched with 16 projects identified to address specific stated areas of natural resources management; with the data from LANDSAT satellites used initially for appropriate methodology definition in each case in anticipation of similar data from the planned IRS missions. The country was, thus, well prepared by these systematic steps taken in advance to the very launch of the IRS-1A satellite. Click here for more detailsPDF - 112 KB"

"event/Megha-Tropiques-1_(MT1)_Controlled_Re-entry_Successful_and_impacted_on_the_Pacific_Ocean","has_description","Mar 07, 2023 The controlled re-entry experiment for the decommissioned Megha-Tropiques-1 (MT-1) was carried out successfully on March 7, 2023. The satellite was launched on October 12, 2011, as a collaborative effort between ISRO and the French space agency CNES for carrying out tropical weather and climate studies. Since August 2022, the satellite's perigee was progressively lowered through a series of 20 manoeuvres spending about 120 kg of fuel. Multiple Manoeuvres including the final de-boost strategy were designed after taking into consideration several constraints, including visibility of the re-entry trace over ground stations, ground impact within the targeted zone, and allowable operating conditions of subsystems, especially the maximum deliverable thrust and the  maximum firing duration constraint on thrusters. All manoeuvre plans were screened to ensure that there would be no post manoeuvre close approaches with other space objects, especially with the crewed space stations like International Space Stations and the Chinese Space Station. MEGHA-TROPIQUES The final two de-boost burns were executed at 11:02 UTC and 12:51 UTC respectively on 7th March 2023 by firing four 11 Newton thrusters on-board the satellite for about 20 minutes each. The final perigee was estimated to be less than 80 km indicating that the satellite would enter the denser layers of the Earth's atmosphere and subsequently undergo structural disintegration. The re-entry aero-thermal flux analysis confirmed that there would be no surviving large debris fragments. Final ground traces of MT1 From the latest telemetry, it is confirmed that the satellite has re-entered the Earth's atmosphere and would have disintegrated over the Pacific Ocean, the final impact region estimated is in the deep Pacific Ocean within the expected latitude & longitude boundaries. The entire sequence of events was carried out from the Mission Operations Complex in ISTRAC. In recent years, ISRO has taken up proactive measures to improve the compliance level with the internationally accepted guidelines on space debris mitigation.  Efforts are underway to build indigenous capabilities for tracking and monitoring space objects to safeguard Indian space assets.

The first test simulated the clustered deployment of two pilot parachutes. One parachute was subjected to a minimum angle with respect to flow conditions and the second parachute was subjected to a maximum angle with respect to flow. These pilot parachutes are used in the Gaganyaan mission to extract and deploy the main parachutes independently. The second test simulated the clustered deployment of two ACS parachutes under maximum dynamic pressure conditions. The test also simulated clustered deployment at a 90-degree angle of attack conditions for the crew module. The ACS parachutes are used in the Gaganyaan mission for the separation of the apex cover mounted on the Crew Module. Both pilot and ACS parachutes were deployed using a pyrotechnic mortar device. The Gaganyaan parachute system development has been a joint effort by VSSC, Thiruvananthapuram and Aerial Delivery Research and Development Establishment (ADRDE), Agra."

"event/Controlled_Re-entry_Experiment_of_Megha-Tropiques-1","has_description","Mar 05, 2023 ISRO is gearing up for a challenging experiment of controlled re-entry of a decommissioned low Earth orbiting satellite, namely Megha-Tropiques-1 (MT1), on March 7, 2023. MT1 was launched on October 12, 2011, as a joint satellite venture of ISRO and the French space agency, CNES for tropical weather and climate studies. Although the mission life of the satellite originally was to 3 years, the satellite continued to provide valuable data services for more than a decade supporting regional and global climate models till 2021. UN/IADC space debris mitigation guidelines recommend deorbiting a LEO (Low Earth Orbit)  object at its end-of-life, preferably through controlled re-entry to a safe impact zone, or by bringing it to an orbit where the orbital lifetime is less than 25 years.It is also recommended to carry out “passivation” of on-board energy sources to minimise the risk of any post-mission accidental break-up. The orbital lifetime of MT1, weighing about 1000 kg, would have been more than 100 years in its 20 deg inclined operational orbit of 867 km altitude. About 125 kg on-board fuel remained unutilised at its end-of-mission that could pose risks for accidental break-up.  This left-over fuel was estimated to be sufficient to achieve a fully controlled atmospheric re-entry to impact an uninhabited location in the Pacific Ocean. Controlled re-entries involve deorbiting to very low altitudes to ensure impact occurs within a targeted safe zone.Usually, large satellites/rocket bodies which are likely to survive aero-thermal fragmentation upon re-entry are made to undergo controlled re-entry to limit ground casualty risk. However, all such satellites are specifically designed to undergo controlled re-entry at end-of-life. MT1 was not designed for EOL operations through controlled re-entry which made the entire exercise extremely challenging. Furthermore, the on-board constraints of the aged satellite, where several systems had lost redundancy and showed degraded performance, and maintaining subsystems under harsher environmental conditions at much lower than originally designed orbital altitude added to the operational complexities. Innovative workarounds were implemented by the operations team based on the study, deliberations, and exchanges among the mission, operations, flight dynamics, aerodynamics, propulsion, controls, navigation, thermal, and other sub-system design teams across the ISRO centres, who worked in synergy to surmount these challenges. An uninhabited area in the Pacific Ocean between 5°S to 14°S latitude and 119°W to 100°W longitude was identified as the targeted re-entry zone for MT1.Since Aug 2022, 18 orbit manoeuvres were performed to progressively lower the orbit. In between the de-orbiting, aero-braking studies at different solar panel orientations were also carried out to gain better insights into the physical process of atmospheric drag affecting the orbital decay of the satellite.The final  de-boost strategy has been designed after taking into consideration several constraints, including visibility of the re-entry trace over ground stations, ground impact within the targeted zone, and allowable operating conditions of subsystems, especially the maximum deliverable thrust and the  maximum firing duration of the thrusters. The final two de-boost burns followed by the ground impact are expected to take place between 16:30 IST to 19:30 IST on March 7, 2023.  Aero-thermal simulations show that no large fragments of the satellites are likely to survive the aerothermal heating during the re-entry. As a responsible space agency committed to safe and sustainable operations in outer space, ISRO proactively takes efforts for better compliance with the UN/IADC space debris mitigation guidelines on post-mission disposal of LEO objects.The re-entry experiment of MT1 has been undertaken as a part of the ongoing efforts as this satellite with sufficient left-over fuel presented a unique opportunity to test the relevant methodologies and understand the associated operational nuances of post mission disposal by direct re-entry into the Earth’s atmosphere."

ISRO has provided the small satellite bus platform to which CNES payload composed of ARGOS-3 and AltiKa instruments (altimeter, radiometer, DORIS, LRA) are integrated. SARAL was launched on February 25, 2013, from SDSC-SHAR, Sriharikota onboard PSLV-C20. The intended mission life was 5 years. Imagined at the turn of the millennium, AltiKa is a technological breakthrough that offered a Ka-band altimeter for the first time to measure the topography of the surface of the oceans. Altika enabled imaging the coasts, rivers and lakes with better resolution than its predecessors. Lesser penetration depth of Ka-band waves into the snow or ice than that of the lower frequency counterparts facilitated more accurate measurement of the altitudes. Besides contributing to the observation of the oceanic circulation of mesoscale (between 50 and 500 km) essential to understanding the dynamics of the ocean and its climatic impacts, AltiKa data are also widely used by glaciologists and hydrologists. Thanks to the efforts of ISRO, CNES, and EUMETSAT operational teams, SARAL is relentlessly pursuing its work as an ocean surveyor for the benefit of the international scientific community and the Copernicus Marine Service."

"event/A_Comprehensive_3D_Thermophysical_Model_for_the_Moon","has_description","Feb 28, 2023 Surface and subsurface temperatures of the Moon are dictated by a complex interplay of several dependent parameters and therefore exhibit a significant variation both at local and regional scales. Knowledge of these temperature variations and thermophysical characteristics of the Moon is an important aspect for its scientific understanding (geophysical characterisation and thermal evolution). Such an information is also essential for planning future in-situ experiments, resource utilisation and even human exploration of the Moon. Scientists at Physical Research Laboratory (PRL), Ahmedabad built a comprehensive three-dimensional thermophysical model for the Moon to derive its surface and sub-surface temperatures. A unique feature of this model is its ability to account for lateral heat transport in three dimensions by utilising the actual topography of any location on the Moon to compute its realistic surface and subsurface temperatures at any scale (from few cms to several kms.) Such a model is not available till date. The model considers all plausible conditions and parameters to derive the temperatures and thermophysical parameters of the lunar surface and subsurface to represent the most realistic scenario. The model results compare well with laboratory experiments and validated using Apollo in situ measurements. Figure 1.Image showing the model derived surface temperatures for a small 100 sqm. area of Apollo 17 landing site, during lunar dusk time (21.5 Earth days). A contrast temperature variation (&bigtriangleup;T = ~300K) within the given area as predicted by the model shows its unique capability which was not available till date. The capability of the model is demonstrated by deriving the thermophysical behaviour of a small area of Apollo 17 landing site at both regional and local scales (Figure 1).  This work has several applications both for lunar science and exploration aspects. To list a few, it can be used to constrain the nature of the outermost porous/dust layer. Knowledge of the nature of this surficial layer on a global scale combined with model calculations of the subsurface heat propagation can help in estimating the subsurface boundary showing the influence of solar insolation. This is an important input for planning the depth of deployment of heat flow probes of future geophysical experiments on the Moon. This information can also effectively be used apriori in determining the lunar heat flow values based on remote observations and theoretical modeling. The unique ability of the model to import any complex topography facilitates the derivation of thermos-physical behaviour for any site of interest on the Moon to understand its local thermos-physics that has significant implications on polar water-ice prospecting studies and in situ resource utilisation. Further, in combination with laboratory measurements, the model will help to interpret data returned from future in-situ experiments, such as ChaSTE experiment on Chandrayaan-3 Lander. This model will also help understanding the local thermal environment of any location on the Moon which is an essential aspect for future human exploration and lunar habitat. Importantly, this work gains significance in view of the recent renewed interest in lunar exploration and planned attempts to send humans back to the Moon. Reference: Durga Prasad, K., Rai, V.

"event/Group_of_lunar_meteorites_suggest_a_new_scenario_for_the_origin_of_lunar_basalts","has_description","Feb 16, 2023 Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) since its inception, has been continuously working towards the betterment of the society, bringing socio-economic benefits to the public. Telemedicine using Communication Satellites offering the required health services to the needy in very remote locations, is one of societal applications having wider impact. The off-shoot of the knowledge developed at the organization has resulted in producing cost effective, efficient systems for regular use in various segments of the society. All this has been possible due to the involvement of different teams across the organization by implementing good quality practices right from the design phase itself. The home grown quality system has helped the organization in achieving repeated successes in managing critical projects and realizing complex missions. Leveraging the benefit of such a proven quality system for societal applications is very much advantageous. Incidence of any human errors in Emergency & Critical care departments of hospitals can lead to fatal conditions. Adopting ISRO's best Quality practices in these areas can certainly benefit millions of patients across the country by reducing the mortality rate. In this direction, the Health-Quest (Quality Upgradation Enabled through Space Technology) programme, a joint effort between ISRO and the Indian medical fraternity, started during the year 2017, has reached its final stage after a series of studies at various hospitals across the country. The study has witnessed the scientific proof of quality enhancement in the Emergency and Critical care departments of the participating hospitals. The pilot study at Dr. Mehta's hospital, Chennai and Narayana Health City, Bangalore, and a full-fledged implementation project involving 10 hospitals from across the country were carried out over a period of one and a half year with the experts reviewing the progress of the study on a weekly basis. The study was completed in January 2023, wherein 16 quality parameters were assessed for each of the participating hospitals. Using a digital platform, the data collected on a real time basis at these hospitals were analysed to understand the areas of improvement and set up focused & specific interventions to improve process parameters.The results are found to be very promising which is evidenced through the reduced mortality rate. The Directorate of Safety, Reliability & Quality (DSRQ) at ISRO Headquarters organised a conclave to deliberate on the consolidated results from the Health-QUEST study on 16th February 2023. Shri Somanath S, Chairman, ISRO/Secretary, DOS chaired the conclave and delivered a keynote address. Open house discussion on the results from the study and the way forward for implementing the devised mechanism across the country was discussed at the conclave. Dr. Brinda V, Director (DSRQ). Dr. Alexander Thomas, President AHPI, Dr. Saravanakumar S, President SEMI etc., participated in the event and shared their experiences and suggestions towards reaping the benefits of the study."

"event/Group_of_lunar_meteorites_suggest_a_new_scenario_for_the_origin_of_lunar_basalts","has_description","Feb 16, 2023 Moon's dark regions, visible to the naked eye, known as the 'mare', are remnants of a violent history of the Solar System. There are no records of these violent events on our dynamic Earth. Moon, having changed very little in the last billions of years, provides us a window to ponder over the past. The large mare regions on the near side of the Moon that we always see from Earth, mainly consists of basalts which are volcanic rocks. These regions hold the key to how the Moon cooled and evolved and what were the sources of heat that melted and crystallized the material to the present day rocks. The Apollo, Luna, and Chang'e-5 missions have brought to Earth an extensive collection of mare basalts. Apollo mare basalts date back to the age of 3.8-3.3 Ga (Ga = one Billion years) and were collected from a region unusually rich in potassium (K), rare Earth elements (REE), and phosphorous (P) (together called as KREEP), known as Procellarum KREEP Terrane (PKT). These are rich in radioactive elements that provided the heat to melt rocks resulting in KREEP rich basalts. Are there alternate ways for melting on the Moon? A team of scientists from Physical Research Laboratory (PRL), Ahmedabad, India, USA and Japan  have found a unique group of ancient lunar basaltic meteorites with very low abundance of KREEP. This suggests that these meteorites must have come from a region different from PKT (Figure 1).  The samples studied in this work are: (i) Lunar meteorite Asuka-881757 found in 1988 at Antartica, collected by National Institute of Polar Research, Japan, (ii) Lunar meteorite Kalahari 009 found in 1999 at Kalahari Desert in South Africa, (iii) Samples collected by Russian Luna-24 mission (location shown on the map). Figure 1.Surface map of the Moon from Chandrayaan-1 mission data, showing two distinct regions. The confined yellow dashed line region marks the Procellarum KREEP Terrane (PKT) at the nearside. Most of the returned lunar mare basalts, which are from the PKT of the Moon, were formed due to mantle melting by radioactive heating. The samples studied in this research are KREEP-free basalts, originated away from the PKT and the meteorites from the unknown locations (away from PKT) on the surface of the Moon. These samples were not formed through the radioactive heating mechanism. The calculations show that these basalts must be a result of low-pressure melting in the Moon, similar to those in other terrestrial bodies, such as Earth and Mars. Further they show that these basalts originated from a cool, shallow, and compositionally distinct part of the lunar interior (Figure 2). Figure 2.A cartoon diagram depicting difference in formation mechanisms of KREEP-free basalts away from the PKT and KREEP-rich basalts from the PKT. While PKT basalts are formed by mixing of radioactive heating at a great depth, the studied lunar meteorites and samples were formed by low pressure (shallow) decompression melting. This study gives global perspective on the thermal evolution of the Moon in comparison to the regional Procellarum KREEP Terrane. This finding suggests that the Moon's interior melted in the form of basalt magmatism from as early as 4.3-3.9 Ga globally to a more localized scenario in the PKT region later (3.8-3.0 Ga). Fundamentally these new results challenge currently proposed scenarios for the generation of basalts and propose an additional new regime that might be more common on the Moon globally.

"event/Commencement_of_Recovery_trials_for_the_Gaganyaan_Mission","has_description","Feb 08, 2023 On February 7, 2023, ISRO, along with Indian Navy carried out initial recovery                                         trials of Crew Module in the Water Survival Test Facility (WSTF) of the Indian                                         Navy, at Kochi. The trials were part of the preparation for crew module recovery                                         operations for the Gaganyaan mission that will be carried out in Indian waters                                         with the participation of Indian Government agencies, the overall recovery                                         operations being led by Indian Navy. A Crew Module Recovery Model (CMRM) that simulates the mass,                                         center of gravity, outer dimensions, and externals of the actual Crew Module at                                         touchdown was used for the trials. The sequence of operations required for the                                         recovery of the Crew Module were carried out as part of the trials. As the safe recovery of the crew is the final step to be                                         accomplished for any successful human spaceflight, it is of paramount importance                                         and it has to be carried out with the minimum lapse of time. Hence the recovery                                         procedures for various scenarios need to be extensively practiced by carrying                                         out a large number of trials. The Standard Operating Procedures (SoP) for                                         recovery of Crew and Crew Module need to be finalized. The recovery trials will                                         be initially carried out in a closed pool followed by trials in a harbor and in                                         the open sea. The operations carried out on February 7, 2023, form the                                         initial recovery trials of Crew Module in a closed pool. Different phases of                                         recovery trials starting with the recovery of the Crew Module to the flight crew                                         training are planned at WSTF. WSTF is a state-of-the-art facility of the Indian                                         Navy that provides realistic training of aircrew for escape from a ditched                                         aircraft under varied simulated conditions and crash scenarios. WSTF simulates                                         different sea state conditions, environmental conditions, and day/night                                         conditions. These trials assist in validating the SoP, and training                                         recovery teams as well as the flight crew. They provide valuable inputs for the                                         utilization of recovery accessories. The feedback from the recovery                                         team/trainers helps improve the recovery operations SoP, design various recovery                                         accessories, and finalize the training plan.

The engine with a nominal thrust of 80t is powering the second stages of PSLV &                                         GSLV, liquid strapons of GSLV and the core liquid stage of LVM3. Liquid engines that support throttling of the engine thrust                                         facilitate booster stage recovery in launch vehicles. In order to enable booster                                         stage recovery in future launch vehicle configurations, the first Throttling                                         demonstration hot test of the Vikas engine was successfully accomplished on                                         January 30, 2023 for a targeted 67% thrust level throttling for a duration of 43                                         s. Throttling of the engine was achieved by a closed loop thrust                                         regulation system and the engine had been successfully throttled from the                                         chamber pressure of 58.5 bar in steps of 50 bar, 45 bar & 40 bar, with dwelling                                         at each pressure level for 7 s. In addition, the Vikas engine was also throttled                                         down to 45% for the last 3 s before the engine shut down. The results of the first hot test of Throttleable Vikas                                         Engine indicate stable combustion and subsystem performed in accordance with the                                         prediction. The overall performance of engine sub-systems, control systems &                                         test facility systems were as expected."

"event/Second_Developmental_Flight_of_SSLV","has_description","Feb 08, 2023 Summary of Failure Analysis of SSLV-D1 Mission & Recommendations for SSLV-D2 Small Satellite Launch Vehicle (SSLV) of ISRO is designed to be affordable and amenable to industry                   production and will function as a launch-on-demand platform for Mini, Micro or Nano satellites. It is                   a three-stage vehicle with all solid propulsion stages and liquid propulsion-based Velocity Trimming                   Module (VTM) as the terminal stage. The launcher also targets many novel features including low                   turn-around time, flexibility in accommodating multiple satellites, launch-on-demand, minimal launch                   infrastructure requirements, etc. The first developmental flight of Small Satellite Launch Vehicle (SSLV) lifted off from Satish Dhawan                   Space Centre (SDSC) on 7thAugust 2022 at 09.18 Hrs IST. The objective of the mission                   (SSLV-D1/EOS-02) was to inject EOS-02 satellite of ISRO into a circular orbit of 356.2 km with an                   inclination of 37.21Â°. Azaadisat, a student satellite was also accommodated in the mission, authorized                   by IN-SPACe. However, the spacecraft were injected into a highly elliptical unstable orbit due to a shortfall in                   velocity, leading to their decay and deorbiting immediately, in spite of normal performance of all                   solid propulsion stages. The orbit achieved was 360.56 km x 75.66 km with an inclination of                   36.56.Initial investigations with the flight data indicated that the lift-off of SSLV D1 was normal                   along with normal performance of all solid propulsion stages.                   However, the mission could not be achieved due to an anomaly during the second stage (SS2) separation,                   which triggered a mission salvage mode (which is a procedure adopted to attempt minimum stabilized                   orbital conditions for the Spacecraft in case of an anomaly in the vehicle system). Subsequent detailed analysis of the flight events and observations ranging from countdown,                               lift-off, propulsion performance, stage separations and satellite injection revealed that                               there was a vibration disturbance for a short duration on the Equipment Bay (EB) deck                               during the second stage (SS2) separation, that affected the Inertial Navigation System                               (INS), resulting in declaring the sensors faulty by the logic in Fault Detection &                               Isolation (FDI) software SSLV Inertial Navigation System Shock and Vibrations during stage separation Satellite injection into an unintended orbit Change of Separation System MINS FDI logic Dynamic characterization and design modification of structures Usage of NaVIC data VTM will be in loop for salvage mode Getting ready for SSLV-D2 The SSLV-D1 was the first developmental mission of this new launch vehicle.                       The objective of development missions is to prove the launch vehicle design and architecture and                       to bring out any residual unknowns not identified in the qualifications tests and analysis during                       its development journey. SSLV-D1 mission demonstrated the satisfactory integrated performance of                       SSLV in all its systems including its flight through the aerodynamic regime, which is an                       accomplishment by itself. Considering the clear identification of the cause of the flight anomaly and                   suggested corrective actions, the next development flight (SSLV-D2) is planned to be executed                   complying to the recommendations, its satisfactory implementation, review and approval by the                   authorized committees. The second developmental flight of SSLV (SSLV-D2/EOS-07 Mission) is scheduled in                   the first quarter of 2023 and will launch a total payload mass of about 334 kg including EOS-07                   satellite and two co-passenger satellites.

The Trisonic Wind Tunnel is a system to aid aerodynamic design of rockets and re-entry spacecrafts by characterizing a scaled model by evaluating forces, moments, load distribution, unsteady pressures, acoustic levels etc. The tunnel has an overall length of about 160m and has a maximum cross section of 5.4m. The tunnel can be used for testing various space vehicles in three flight regimes - below the speed of sound, at the speed of sound and above the speed of sound: hence the name trisonic wind tunnel. The tunnel can simulate flight conditions from 0.2 times the speed of sound (68 m/s) to 4 times the speed of sound (1360 m/s). The blow down was formally switched on by Shri S Somanath, Chairman, ISRO/Secretary, DOS in presence of senior officials of ISRO including Dr S Unnikrishnan Nair, Director, VSSC, Dr. V Narayanan, Director, LPSC and Dr D Sam Dayala Dev, Director,IISU.

The image of the cyclone (above) is a combination of cloud structure captured by Ocean Colour Monitor (OCM) with wind vector data derived from the Scatterometer.Â  Â High winds associated with the cyclone centre could be well-captured due to a unique combination of optical and microwave remote sensing-based data. OCM onboard EOS-06 has identified algae (coccolithophore) bloom off the coast of Argentina in the South Atlantic Ocean. Â Overgrowth of Coccolith formation is potentially harmful. It reduces the alkalinity of seawater and releases CO2 and thus plays an important role in ocean biogeochemistry.Â More Details"

The Hon’ble former President recollected the                     significant contributions of the pioneers in Indian Space Research including that of Dr Vikram                     Sarabhai, Prof Satish Dhawan and Dr APJ Abdul Kalam. He mentioned that at this historic moment the entire nation is proud of the R&D                     community of our country. He mentioned that November happens to be an important month for Indian                     rocketry. It was on 21stNovember 1963 that the first Sounding Rocket was launched from                     Indian soil. Shri S Somanath, Secretary DoS, who spoke on the occasion mentioned that rocketry is a                     serious task. The private launch of a small rocket that was undertaken recently emulated an effort                     demonstrated in the late 1960s by ISRO. There is a long way to go and each step is to be taken with                     due diligence. Dr S Unnikrishnan Nair, Director, VSSC welcomed the gathering. Later, the honourable former President visited the Space Museum and Control                     Centre and witnessed the 200thconsecutive successful flight of RH200 which took off at                     11.55 AM IST today the 23rd November 2022 from TERLS Launch pad. Indian sounding rockets are used as privileged tools for the scientific                     community for carrying out experiments on meteorology, astronomy and similar branches of Space                     Physics. Campaigns such as Equatorial ElectroJet (EEJ), Leonid Meteor Shower (LMS), Indian Middle                     Atmosphere Programme (IMAP), Monsoon Experiment (MONEX), Middle Atmosphere Dynamics (MIDAS),                     Sooryagrahan-2010, etc. have been conducted using the sounding rocket platform for scientific                     exploration of the Earth’s atmosphere. The RSR series of rockets have been the forerunners for ISROs heavier and more                     complex launch vehicles, with a continued usage even today for atmospheric and                     meteorological studies. They are an indispensible part of our Space Programme, which has become                     every Indian’s hope and pride. The 200thconsecutive successful flight stands testimony                     to the commitment of Indian rocket scientists towards unmatched reliability demonstrated over the                     years.

This test marks a significant milestone toward realizing the nation's ambitious Gaganyaan project. Parachute based Deceleration system for Crew module For Gaganyaan Crew module, the Parachute system consists of a totally of 10 no. of parachutes. In flight, the parachute sequence starts with deployment of 2 Nos. of Apex cover separation parachutes (protection cover for the Crew Module Parachute compartment) followed by 2 Nos. of Drogue parachute deployment to stabilise & bring down the velocity. Upon Drogue parachute release, 3 Nos. of Pilot chute will be used to extract 3 Nos. of Main parachute individually, to reduce the speed of the Crew module to safe levels during its landing. Two of the three main chutes are sufficient to land the astronauts on earth, and the third is redundant. Each parachute's performance must be evaluated by complex testing methods using Rail Track Rocket Sled (RTRS) tests for smaller Parachutes and Aircraft/ Helicopters for the Main parachutes. The Integrated Main Parachute Airdrop Test simulated the case when one Main parachute failed to open and it is the first in a series of tests planned to simulate different failure conditions of the parachute system before it is deemed qualified to be used in the first human spaceflight mission. In this test, a 5-ton dummy mass, equivalent to the Crew module mass, was taken to an altitude of 2.5 kilometres and dropped using the Indian Air force’s IL-76 aircraft. Two small pyro-based mortar-deployed pilot parachutes, then pulled the Main parachutes. The fully inflated Main parachutes reduced the payload speed to a safe landing speed as the entire sequence lasted about 2-3 minutes and the payload mass landed softly on the ground.                                 The design and development of the Parachute based Deceleration system for Crew module is a joint venture between Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and the Defence Research and Development Organization (DRDO) and with this test, a significant milestone toward realizing the nation's ambitious Gaganyaan project is achieved with the active coordination between the country’s premier agencies, namely ISRO, DRDO, the Indian air force, and the Indian Army.

With the proper maintenance of orbit and mission planning by the spacecraft operations team in ISRO, by economical usage of fuel RISAT-2 provided very useful payload data for 13 years. Since its injection RISAT-2’s radar payload services were provided for various space applications. On re-entry, there were no fuel left in the satellite and hence there are no contaminations or explosion by fuel is expected.Studies confirmed that the pieces generated due to aero-thermal fragmentation would not have survived re-entry heating and hence no fragments would have impacted on Earth. Indian System for Safe and Sustainable Space Operations Management (IS4OM) facility in ISTRAC/ISRO had been monitoring the re-entry for the last one month with analysis carried out by VSSC and ISTRAC teams through its in-house developed analysis software and tracking the object utilizing Multi Object Tracking Radar (MOTR) at SDSC, Sriharikota. MOTR tracked RISAT-2 regularly and the data were used for further analysis and Orbit determination. The orbital data available from USSPACECOM were regularly used to predict the re-entry time and impact. ISRO’s in house predictions are shown in Figure 1 with the lower and upper bounds. Figure 1: Re-entry Predictions of RISAT-2 made using in-house software It can be seen that near to the re-entry epoch, prediction became better and better. Final ground trace showed in Figure 2, clearly indicate that impact is in Indian Ocean. Figure 2: Final Orbit Ground Trace of RISAT-2 RISAT-2 is a clear example of ISRO’s capability to carry out spacecraft orbital operations in an efficient and optimal way. As RISAT-2 re-entered within 13.5 years, it complied with all necessary international mitigation guidelines for Space Debris, showing ISRO’s commitment towards long term sustainability of Outer Space as well."

AstroSat                                     data has also resulted in more than 700 conference proceedings, astronomer’s                                     telegrams and other non-refereed publications. Directors of the TIFR, Mumbai and IIA, Bangalore along with                                     representatives of international collaborators from CSA and the University of                                     Leicester shared their experience and comments on AstroSat. They requested ISRO to                                     continue providing support in realizing new science missions. Shri A S Kirankumar, Member, Space Commission mentioned the                                     realization of AstroSat and how AstroSat is providing virgin data to Indian and                                     international users leading to cutting-edge science. Dr. K Kasturirangan, former                                     Chairman, ISRO elucidated the development of X-ray science in India, and initial                                     payload development activities taken-up by the scientists leading to AstroSat. He                                     also enlightened the gathering about how the inter-desciplinary expertise of                                     founders helped ISRO to reach its current position. During his address, Shri S Somanath, Chairman ISRO / Secretary, DOS, mentioned some                                     of the discoveries from AstroSat exemplified the multi-institute nature of the                                     mission, how different research institutes from India realized multiple payloads                                     onboard AstroSat and also talked about the international collaboration. Shri                                     Somanath informed ISRO’s upcoming science missions and posed new challenges to the                                     research community on how to benefit from the AstroSat experience for ISRO’s future                                     humanned missions. One such challenge is estimating the radiation environment and                                     how to safeguard the astronauts from the harmful effects of radiation. Chairman,                                     ISRO also said how AstroSat data has led to several discoveries and other exciting                                     results like solving the puzzle of a red star bright in Ultra-violet, detection of                                     X-ray polarization from the off-pulse region of Crab pulsar, enhanced emission from                                     Butterfly nebula, maximally spinning black hole to rare triple thermonuclear bursts                                     from an X-ray binary. One of the major results of AstroSat is the discovery of Lyman                                     alpha photons from a galaxy 9.3 billion years away. The discussions and deliberations during the meeting ranged from                                     the study of eruptions from the nearest star Proxima Centauri at just 4 light years                                     away, to Far Ultra-violet photons from 9.3 billion light years away, demonstrating                                     the efficacy of AstroSat. There were mainly four scientific sessions organised in                                     the two-day conference. The first session discussed the top results from AstroSat,                                     which covered various science problems from star formation studies to X-ray                                     polarimetry of GRBs to the already mentioned result on Lyman continuum emission from                                     z=1.42 galaxy. As AstroSat is capable of simultaneous measurements in multiple                                     wavebands, there were talks on using this unique capability. This was followed by a session on the results from the                                     ISRO-sponsored projects where a total of eleven papers were discussed covering                                     wide-ranging topics, galaxies to blazars, low-masss and high-mass X-ray binaries,                                     jets and other interesting astrophysical processes. In the session on invited talks                                     of 15 minutes were presented again with a wide range of topics covering accreting                                     neutron stars, FUV emission from dwarf galaxies, broadband properties of binaries,                                     detection of quasi periodic oscillations (QPO) etc. A session dedicated to potential astronomy program concepts of                                     ISRO discussed a UV mission capable of deepest UV imaging and to fill-in a niche                                     area in the coming years, followed by a mission for broadband X-ray spectral and                                     polarization measurements. The conference ended with the interaction of selected scientists                                     with Shri A S Kirankumar, Chairman APEX Science board, where mainly human resource                                     generation and training at various stages like at University research fellows to                                     Post-doctoral fellows was discussed. The session ended with Shri A S Kirankumar                                     providing important inputs for both human resource generation and future astronomy                                     programs and, hardware development, involving students and faculty from                                     universities. AstroSat is truly a result of multi-institute international                                     collaboration. The effort and the hardwork involved in realizing the mission are                                     providing great results and is also evident by the fact that, a mission designed for                                     five years of operation has exceeded it by 2 years already. AstroSat mission is                                     working satisfactorily and is expected to provide niche science data for several                                     more years. It will continue to serve the astronomy community even after attaining                                     its end in the form of archival data."

"event/X-rays_from_the_Moon_reveal_a_new_lunar_map_in_sodium","has_description","X-rays from the Moon reveal a new lunar map in sodiumHome Oct 7, 2022 Figure 1:Moon in visible light showing the apparent features Mare (dark regions) and Highlands (bright regions) The X-ray spectrometer CLASS on the Chandrayaan-2 Orbiter has mapped the abundance of sodium on the Moon for the first time. The serene radiance that fills the vast expanse of a night sky is the reflection of sunlight from the Moon's surface, a major part of which is from the bright lunar highlands. The rock and soil samples that the Apollo 11 astronauts brought to Earth showed that these regions which are remnants of an ancient lunar crust, are mainly composed of silicate minerals in the group plagioclase feldspar series. While these are common minerals found on Earth, lunar samples have a variety of the mineral that contain more of the element Calcium than Sodium (which is an alternative) following the general trend in compositional differences between Earth and Moon. A loss of volatile elements including alkalis like sodium and potassium on the Moon could be traced back to the time when Earth and Moon formed together in a Solar system that was young and fiery. Successive laboratory investigations of the returned samples (Apollo, Luna and Chang'e) widened the range of compositions but the fundamental conclusions have remained. However, the returned samples are from a few specific regions of the Moon which do not necessarily represent the global lunar composition. Sodium is one of those elements that do not have a telltale signature in the visible or near-infrared wavelengths and has thus not been targeted via remote sensing observations. Chandrayaan-1 X-ray Fluorescence Spectrometer (C1XS) detected sodium from its characteristic line in X-rays which opened up the possibility of mapping the amount of sodium on the Moon. In a recent work published in The Astrophysical Journal Letters, Chandrayaan-2 mapped the abundance of sodium on the Moon (Figure 2) for the very first time using its large area X-ray spectrometer, CLASS. Built at the U R Rao Satellite Centre of ISRO in Bengaluru, CLASS provides clean signatures of the sodium line thanks to its high sensitivity and performance. The study finds that a part of the signal could be arising from a thin veneer of sodium atoms weakly bound to the lunar grains Figure 2:A map of sodium abundance on the Moon measured by the Chandrayaan-2 Large Area Soft X-ray Spectrometer plotted on the lunar albedo map from NASA's LROC camera Figure 3:Findings from Chandrayaan-2 suggest there are two kinds of sodium atoms on the Moon's surface, those that are loosely bound on the surface and those that are part of the minerals. External agents such as solar radiation liberate the loosely bound atoms more easily thus acting as a source of the atoms in the lunar exosphere. These sodium atoms can be nudged out of the surface by solar wind or Ultra Violet radiation more easily than if they were part of the lunar minerals. Also shown is a diurnal variation of the surface sodium that would explain the continuous supply of atoms to the exosphere, sustaining it. An interesting aspect that widens the interest in this alkali element is its presence in the wispy atmosphere of the Moon, a region so thin that the atoms there rarely meet. This region termed an 'exosphere' begins at the surface of the Moon and extends several thousand kilometers merging into the interplanetary space. Potter and Morgan in 1988 measured from ground, sodium atoms in the lunar exosphere. Since then, ground telescopes have taken images of this faint sodium glow around the Moon, which is just the color of light emitted by a sodium vapor lamp. What has been elusive is the source of these atoms on the Moon's surface. The new findings from Chandrayaan-2, provide an avenue to study surface-exosphere interaction on the Moon, which would aid development of similar models for Mercury and other airless bodies in our Solar System and beyond.

Equipped with a suit of five scientific payloads onboard, during these eight years, the mission has gifted significant scientific understanding on the Martian surface features, morphology, as well as the Martian atmosphere and exosphere. Dr. K. Radhakrishnan, Member Space Commission, during his special address, mentioned about the unique lessons learnt from this mission; despite being realized in a remarkably short turn-around time, the MOM mission has added enormous values to the domains of science, technology, and management. It was an enormous feat to have reached the Martian orbit successfully in the maiden attempt, he mentioned. Shri. A.S. Kiran Kumar, Member Space Commission mentioned about the criticality of the payload operations in the Martian orbit, given the conflicting requirements of the payload operations, radio delay, and white-out and black-out conjunctions. During the inaugural address, Shri S. Somanath, Chairman, ISRO / Secretary, DOS, summarized the major scientific feats of the mission. He mentioned that the Mars Orbiter Mission has gifted an understanding of the composition of several gases in the Martian exosphere, quantified the altitude where the Martian atmosphere has a transition from the CO2 rich regime to atomic Oxygen-rich regime during the local evening. The mission is also credited with the discovery of ‘suprathermal’ Argon-40 atoms in the Martian exosphere, which gave some clue on one of the potential mechanisms for the escape of atmosphere from Mars. Chairman, ISRO further mentioned that the observation of the Martian dust storm from the MOM spacecraft gifted an understanding of the dynamics of the dust on the planet, as well as a potential mechanism of escape of the Martian atmosphere.  The Atmospheric optical depth was estimated with the help of the MOM observations and the studies reported the presence of lee-wave clouds above the southern wall of Valles Marineris. The MOM spacecraft photographed, for the first time, the far side of Deimos, one of the natural satellites of Mars. The mission could capture the full disc image of Mars because of its elliptical orbit; it also generated an atlas of Mars with the help of the colour camera onboard the mission. The mission also captured the time-variation of the Martian polar ice caps; it also measured the Martian apparent albedo that indicated the reflecting power of the Martian surface. The mission also gave an opportunity to classify extra-terrestrial landslides using machine learning models. During the meet, it was also presented that there has been a high demand for the Mars Orbiter Mission data globally. So far, more than 7200 users have registered to download the MOM data from the portal of the Indian Space Science Data Centre (ISSDC), and about 27000 downloads of science data have been carried out so far. Among the registered users, about 400 are international users from 50 countries. The mission has also contributed to Human Resource Generation in the domain of planetary sciences; it has generated several Ph.D holders, while many of the research scholars are using the data from the mission to pursue their doctoral work. The deliberations during the national meet covered topics on the challenges faced by the Mars Orbiter Mission, lessons learnt from them, how to access the mission data from the portal of the Indian Space Science Data Centre (ISSDC), as well as a series of detailed presentations on the science outcomes by the principal investigator teams as well as the academia partners. A session was dedicated to a panel discussion on ‘Future Exploration of the Inner Solar System: Scope and the Focus Areas’ with the participation of Indian academia/institutes and ISRO/DOS. It was also discussed that despite being designed for a life-span of six months as a technology demonstrator, the Mars Orbiter Mission has lived for about eight years in the Martian orbit with a gamut of significant scientific results on Mars as well as on the Solar corona, before losing communication with the ground station, as a result of a long eclipse in April 2022.                                          During the national meet, ISRO deliberated that the propellant must have                                         been exhausted, and therefore, the desired attitude pointing could not be achieved for sustained power generation. It was declared that the spacecraft is non-recoverable, and attained its end-of-life. The mission will be ever-regarded as a remarkable technological and scientific feat in the history of planetary exploration.

"event/ISRO_develops_microprocessor-controlled_smart_limbs","has_description","ISRO develops microprocessor-controlled smart limbsHome Sep 23, 2022 As a spin-off of Space technology, ISRO develops an intelligent artificial limb                                     likely to be commercialised soon, expectedly cheaper by about ten times, benefitting                                     above-knee amputees to walk with a comfortable gait. These                                     ‘microprocessor-controlled knees (MPKs)’ offer extended capabilities for the amputee                                     than those offered by the passive limbs that do not use the microprocessors. Thus                                     far, a 1.6 kg MPK has enabled an amputee to walk about 100 m in the corridor with                                     minimum support. Efforts to improvise the performance are underway. These smart MPKs are being developed by Vikram Sarabhai Space                                     Centre (VSSC), ISRO under an MoU with National Institute for Locomotor disabilities                                     (NILD), Pt. Deendayal Upadhyaya National Institute for Persons with Physical                                     Disabilities (Divyangjan) (PDUNIPPD (D)), and Artificial Limb Manufacturing                                     Corporation of India (ALIMCO). Configuration and working An MPK consists of a microprocessor, hydraulic damper, load & knee angle sensors,                                     composite knee-case, Li-ion battery, electrical harness, and interface elements. The                                     microprocessor detects the state of gait based on the sensor data. The control                                     software estimates the real-time damping needed to attain the desired gait by                                     changing the stiffness of the system that is achieved by a hydraulic damper operated                                     by a DC motor. Walking parameters specific to amputees can be set using PC-based                                     software to improve one’s comfort. The interface plots the parameters in real time                                     during walking. Development of the system The development of MPK was a multi-disciplinary,                                             multi-stage activity. After arriving at a configuration based on the                                             literature, validating it through kinematics analysis for estimating the                                             sub-system requirements, multiple models of the system were developed. The                                             feasibility of the design was verified using an engineering model. The                                             system consisted of an aluminium knee case, a solenoid valve-based damper,                                             and a six-axis load cell. While the next engineering model included a                                             stepper motor-based damper and composite knee case, the subsequent model                                             utilised DC motor-based damper with a spool position sensor, pylon                                             integrated load cell, miniaturised control electronics, and a Graphical user                                             interface for parameter tuning. Testing and walking trials at VSSC The sub-systems of the limb, viz. hydraulic damper,                                             control electronics, and load cell, were tested and characterised in                                             stand-alone mode, using customised setups. An ingenious method was conceived                                             for conducting the walking trials with non-amputee involving a                                             custom-designed exo-socket realised for the purpose. Multiple walking trials                                             conducted with non-amputee enabled the updating of the control software and                                             fine-tuning of the parameters. Walking trails with amputees at NILD With the clearance of the Joint Project Monitoring                                             Committee (JPMC), the device was tested with an amputee, identified by NILD                                             for conducting walking trials. The trials were conducted at NILD lab jointly                                             by NILD and VSSC. The socket and fitment of MPK to amputee were realised                                             NILD. VSSC tuned amputee-specific parameters. Initial walking trials were                                             conducted with the support of parallel bars. Subsequently, the amputee could                                             walk about 100 m in the corridor with minimum support. All the sub-systems                                             of the knee performed satisfactorily. Further plans MPKs currently available commercially in India are                                             imported and range from Rs. 10 Lakh to Rs. 60 Lakhs, depending on the                                             complexity and functionality. MPKs being developed, once commercialised, are                                             expected to cost around Rs. 4 Lakh to Rs. 5 Lakh. Optimisation of MPKs in                                             terms of mass and envelope size is underway. More intelligence is being                                             incorporated into the system to help the amputee walk through uneven                                             terrains with advanced features for more comfort."

The motor used Hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene (HTPB) as fuel and liquid oxygen (LOX) as the oxidizer. Unlike solid-solid or liquid-liquid combinations, a hybrid motor uses solid fuel and liquid oxidizer. Today’s test of a flight equivalent 30 kN hybrid motor demonstrated ignition and sustained combustion for the intended duration of 15 seconds. The motor performance was satisfactory. The use of liquids facilitates throttling and the control over the flow rate of LOX enables the re-start capability. While both HTPB and LOX are green, LOX is safer to handle. The hybrid motor tested today is scalable and stackable, potentially paving the way for a new propulsion system for the forthcoming launch vehicles."

The Crew Escape System (CES) takes away the Crew module of Gaganyaan mission in case of any eventuality and rescues the astronauts. In case of mission-abort during the initial phase of flight, LEM provides required thrust to CES, to take away Crew Module from the launch vehicle. LEM is a distinctive special purpose solid rocket motor with four reverse flow nozzles and generates maximum sea level thrust of 842 kN (nominal) with burn time of 5.98 s (nominal). The nozzle end of LEM is mounted at the fore end of the launch vehicle unlike at aft end in conventional rocket motors to avoid exhaust plume impingement on crew module. This necessitates the use of a reverse flow multiple nozzle in this solid rocket motor. The reverse flow nozzle implies the reversal of the exhaust gas flow direction in the nozzle region. The main objectives of the static test are:"

Since the ionosphere derives its origin from the atmosphere the plasma density at the Moon is considered to be only a few hundred ions per cubic centimeter. Measurements made using the Dual Frequency Radio Science (DFRS) experiment onboard Chandrayaan-2 orbiter, however, have shown that Moon 's ionosphere has a plasma density of the order of 104cm-3, in the wake region which is at least one order of magnitude more than that is present in the day side. Chandrayaan-2, the second Indian Lunar exploration mission launched by the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) on 22 July 2019, carried several payloads, among which the DFRS was designed to study the lunar ionosphere. It uses two coherent signals at the S-band (2240 MHz) and X-band (8496 MHz) of radio frequencies, transmitted from the Chandrayaan-2 orbiter and received at the ground station at Byalalu, Bangalore to explore the lunar plasma ambiance using the radio occultation (RO) technique. Simultaneous measurements by two coherent radio signals help to mitigate the effect of the Earth 's atmosphere and any uncertainties due to various sources during the experiments. The DFRS payload was conceptualized and jointly developed by Space Physics Laboratory (SPL) of Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre, Trivandrum; UR Rao Space Centre (URSC), Bangalore; and ISRO Telemetry, Tracking, and Command Network (ISTRAC), Bangalore. For the RO observations, an algorithm to estimate the integrated electron density profile was developed at SPL and used to study the Moon 's ionosphere in the lunar wake region, a region of the Lunar ionosphere that does not directly interact with the solar wind. A total of 12 radio occultation experiments have been conducted in campaign mode on four different occasions based on carefully selected geometry suitable for the RO measurements. Detailed analysis shows that the total electron content along the ray path in the Lunar ionosphere can be as large as 1.5 TECU (1 TECU = 1016m-2) with the uncertainty of 0.15 TECU, in the Lunar wake region. Large electron content is also seen near lunar polar regions during solar twilight conditions. These findings are unique and first of its kind as they show substantial post-sunset enhancement in plasma density compared to the dayside values reported so far by earlier missions. The observed large enhancements in electron density in the Lunar wake region open new dimensions in understanding the lunar dark side plasma environment. In the wake region, neither the solar radiation nor the solar wind interacts directly with the available neutral particles, but still, the plasma is getting generated. Numerical simulations of the dark side of plasma environment using a 3-dimensional Lunar Ionospheric Model (3D-LIM) developed at SPL suggest that the production of ions by charge exchange reactions may play a pivotal role in producing a significantly large plasma density in the Lunar wake region, which can sustain for a longer period.  The model suggests that the dominant ions in the wake region are Ar+, and Ne+which have a comparatively longer lifetime than the molecular ions (CO2+, and H2O+)  that are dominant at other regions. On the other hand, fraction of the ions produced by solar radiation during the daytime is swept by solar wind, leading to reduced daytime plasma density. These path-breaking scientific results on the Moon's ionosphere using DFRS payload onboard the Chandrayaan-2 orbiter and modeling of the physical mechanism are published in the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society- Letter; ""A study on the characteristic features of the Lunar ionosphere using dual-frequency radio science (DFRS) experiment onboard Chandrayaan-2 orbiter"", Keshav R.

"event/ISRO_ORGANISES_ACADEMIA-INSTITUTE-MINISTRY_MEET_FOR_SPACE-BASED_AERONOMY_MISSION","has_description","ISRO ORGANISES ACADEMIA-INSTITUTE-MINISTRY MEET FOR SPACE-BASED AERONOMY MISSIONHome/Archives/ISRO ORGANISES ACADEMIA-INSTITUTE-MINISTRY MEET ISRO had organized a National meeting on Aeronomy research to discuss the importance and prospect of space-based in-situ observation of the Earth’s upper atmosphere to study the space-weather effects, with the theme ‘Science of Near-Earth Space & Applications’, on May 10, 2022, in virtual mode. The meeting was attended by representatives of several ministries of the Government of India, academicians and scientists from several reputed academic institutions. Introducing the theme, during the inaugural session, Shri Shantanu Bhatwadekar, Scientific Secretary, ISRO, explained that ‘Aeronomy’ refers to the physics and chemistry of the Earth’s upper atmosphere, which directly feels the wrath of the space weather events. In the near-Earth environment, the space weather is governed by the eruptive phenomena from the Sun, which affect the ionosphere-thermosphere system severely, and the perturbation percolates to the lower altitudes                                              depending on the intensity of the solar events. In this context, Scientific Secretary, ISRO mentioned that the DISHA-H&L mission, a twin Aeronomy mission conceptualized by ISRO, comprising two satellites, one at high (DISHA-H, at inclination greater than 85 degrees) and the other one at low (DISHA-L, at an inclination of about 25 degrees) inclination orbits, simultaneously orbiting the Earth at an altitude of ~400 km. He mentioned that DISHA is an acronym for ‘Disturbed and                                              Quiet time Ionosphere-Thermosphere systems at High Altitudes’. The twin satellites, he informed, with the identical set of scientific instruments, will capture the latitudinal and longitudinal effects of the space weather events on the Earth’s upper atmosphere. Shri S. Somanath, Chairman, ISRO / Secretary, DOS, inaugurated the meet. During his inaugural address, he emphasized the necessity of bringing out the societal benefit of the proposed DISHA H&L mission. He mentioned that the proposed DISHA H&L mission will provide valuable scientific insight into the effect of space weather events on Earth’s upper atmosphere, which, in turn, will help in the modelling of the ionosphere-thermosphere system in terms of its response to the space weather                                              events. The model will not only be a valuable scientific contribution towards the understanding of the Sun-Earth connection but also be a tool for several applications that are susceptible to the space weather events. He solicited the active participation of the academia, institutes and ministries to build a strong user-base for this mission. Prof. Pallam Raju, Dean, Physical Research Laboratory, an autonomous body within the Department of Space, made a presentation on the DISHA H&L concept, the parameters to be investigated, and the scientific instruments. The meeting, apart from several lectures from academia and institutes, witnessed a panel discussion on ‘Science of Near-Earth space and its applications’, which was attended by the senior officials nominated by the Department of Telecommunication, Ministry of Civil Aviation, Ministry of Power, Ministry of Earth Sciences, Department of Science & Technology, Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology and Ministry of Information and Broadcasting. The panelists deliberated the importance                                              of such space-based Aeronomy missions with relevance to the respective ministries. Discussions spun the domains of the disruption of radio-wave propagation affecting communication and navigation infrastructure during severe space-weather events, the need for coupling the ionosphere-thermosphere model and atmospheric model to build a holistic model to assess the effects of space weather events on the atmosphere, passenger health in aviation sector during polar flights, the importance of the Aeronomy                                              study on the air navigation services, need for parallel/super-computing facilities for high spatial-temporal modelling of the Sun-Earth coupling system will better accuracy, to name a few. Ministry representatives offered collaborative support to take this endeavor forward. Dr. Tirtha Pratim Das, Director, Science Programme Office, moderated the inter-ministerial panel discussion. He mentioned that DISHA H&L is just an initial step towards the building of the space infrastructure towards achieving self-reliance in modelling and managing space weather events. Fullfilling this goal necessitates drawing a long-term plan covering many solar cycles, which, in turn, requires a programmatic approach, with the confluence of the wisdom and active participation of the relevant ministries.                                              Once Aditya-L1 heliophysics observatory is in orbit and study the causes of the space weather events, DISHA H&L will studies the effects. The ground-based observations of the ionosphere and the Sun will complement the space-based observations.  Thus, DISHA H&L will add to the space and ground-based infrastructure for achieving a better understanding of the space weather effects, which will eventually lead to better planning for the protection of the space and ground-based assets. The event was live-streamed to the ISRO website, and theISRO social mediaplatforms.The recording of the meet can be viewed onYoutube/ISRO Official"

Firms handed                                     over the modules to the Chairman, ISRO, in a function held last month. RF Packages and Actuation systems are among the most complex systems in a launch                                     vehicle. Their realization is equally challenging. RF system realization involves                                     intricate frequency tuning, complex integration and rigorous testing. Realisation of                                     actuation systems encompasses complex                                     mechanical and electrical integration requiring vast skill in both areas. Thus, the                                     realization of RF and actuation systems predominantly remains an in-house activity.                                     However, the demand to focus on new technology developments prompted VSSC management                                     to open the doors to private partners by adopting                                     the GOCO model for the realization and testing of RF packages and Actuation systems                                     for launch vehicles. The success of the GOCO model elsewhere including that in VSSC                                     for surface treatment of mechanical parts also gave an impetus to the decision. An Expression of Interest (EoI) was floated and then the Requests for Proposal                                     (RFPs) were sought. Finally, SFO Technologies, Thiruvananthapuram and Hical                                     Technologies, Bengaluru were contracted to realize RF Systems and Actuators,                                     respectively. RF Systems GOCO Facility RF packages are used in the telemetry and telecommand functions of a satellite                                     launch vehicle mission. Three RF Packages were identified for realization through                                     the GOCO facility: Programmable S-Band Transmitter (PSBT), Solid-state C-Band                                     Transponder and Digital Telecommand Receiver (DTCR).

Skillset demanded by the activity was imparted                                     to                                     the industry. Training at a Hi-reliability soldering school and hands-on training on                                     tuning/testing of the package by                                     RF domain experts were crucial. Technical manpower provided by industry partners                                     quickly                                     absorbed the skills. GOCO facility commenced operations on 6th August 2021. It                                     realized                                     RF Transmitters, Transponders and Receivers in a short duration.

S. Somanath, in presence of Director, VSSC Dr. Unnikrishnan                                     Nair. Actuator GOCO Facility Electromechanical Actuators are utilized in the control and guidance of satellite                                     launch vehicles to ensure proper thrust vector control of propulsion stages by                                     alignment of nozzles in desired directions. Twelve types of Electromechanical                                     Actuators for PSLV, GSLV and GSLV MkIII were identified                                     for production in GOCO mode. The facility was established with bonded stores, a fitting shop, assembly and                                     inspection areas, and a fully equipped Class-1000 clean room. All electrical and                                     mechanical tools, test fixtures and test equipment and checkouts were also                                     installed. Effective knowledge transfer to the company personnel was                                     ensured through lectures, Hi-reliability soldering school and interactive sessions. The facility commenced its operation on 6th January 2021. Actuators started rolling                                     out of the facility in August 2021, despite the pandemic-induced restrictions.

"event/GSLV-F10/EOS-03_Mission_Failure","has_description","GSLV-F10/EOS-03 Mission Failure: Failure Analysis Committee submits conclusions & recommendationsHome/Archives/GSLV-F10/EOS-03 Mission Failure The GSLV-F10/EOS-03 Mission lifted-off normally from Sriharikota on August 12,2021 at 0543 hrs after a smooth countdown of 26 hours. In the flight,                                              the performance of the first stage (GS1), the strap-on stages (L40) and the second stage (GS2) were satisfactory and in accordance with the pre-flight                                              predictions. However, the onboard computer aborted the mission at 307 seconds into the flight leading to mission failure. Initial investigations with the post-flight data conducted immediately after the launch indicated that an anomaly in the Cryogenic Upper Stage led to the                                              mission abort. A National level Failure Analysis Committee (FAC) consisting of experts from academia & ISRO, was constituted to identify the causes of the                                              anomaly and to recommend corrective actions for future missions. The FAC has thoroughly reviewed the flight data along with all data related to the activities                                              ranging from the stage preparation at the launch complex, countdown to lift-off. The Failure Analysis Committee recommended a series of computer simulations &                                              confirmatory ground tests to simulate the conditions very close to the GSLV-F10 flight scenario and validate the findings of the Committee. Subsequently, the                                              respective teams have completed the simulations & ground tests and presented the results, based on which FAC has completed its deliberations and presented its                                              findings and conclusion on March 24, 2022. The time line of flight events and major observations on the Cryogenic Upper Stage in the GSLV-F10 mission along with all previous GSLV missions, were thoroughly                                              discussed and deliberated. FAC observed that a deviation in performance of the Cryogenic Upper Stage (CUS) was observed at  297.3 sec after lift-off due to which                                              the onboard computer aborted the mission at 307 sec.The ground servicing of the Cryogenic Stage was normal and the required lift-off conditions were achieved.                                              However, subsequent to lift-off, the Committee observed that the build-up of pressure in the propellant (Liquid Hydrogen or LH2) tank during the flight was not normal                                              leading to a lower tank pressure at the time of ignition of the engine. This resulted in anomalous operation of the Fuel Booster Turbo Pump (FBTP) mounted inside the                                              LH2 tank which feeds the main turbopump of the engine resulting in insufficient flow of Liquid Hydrogen into the engine thrust chamber. Detailed studies indicate that                                              the most likely reason for the observed reduction in LH2 tank pressure is a leak in the respective Vent and Relief Valve (VRV), which is used for relieving the excess                                              tank pressure during flight. Computer simulations as well as multiple confirmatory ground tests, closely simulating the conditions in the GSLV-F10 flight, validated                                              the analysis by the FAC. The FAC concluded that the lower LH2 tank pressure at the time of CUS engine ignition, caused by the leakage of Vent & Relief Valve (VRV) resulted in the malfunctioning of                                              the Fuel Booster Turbo Pump (FBTP) leading to mission abort command & subsequent failure of the mission. The most probable reason for the leakage of VRV valve is attributed                                              to the damage in the soft seal that could have occurred during the valve operations or due to contamination and valve mounting stresses induced under cryogenic temperature                                              conditions. The committee has submitted comprehensive recommendations to enhance the robustness of the Cryogenic Upper Stage for future GSLV missions, which includes an active LH2 tank                                               pressurization system to be incorporated to ensure sufficient pressure in the LH2 tank at the appropriate time before engine start command, strengthening of Vent & Relief                                               Valve and associated fluid circuits to avoid the possibility of leakage along with the automatic monitoring of additional cryogenic stage parameters for giving lift-off                                               clearance ."

These space objects move with an average speed of 27,000 km per hour in Low Earth Orbits,                                         therefore, a collision with even a centimetre sized tiny fragment can be catastrophic to an operational space asset. These                                          orbiting space debris pose a threat to about 3000 operational satellites presently in orbit, used for critical modern communication,                                         commerce, travel and security systems. Any damage, even minor, to the operational space assets will have cascading impacts on many                                          vital systems including communication, finance, power, transportation, time scheduling and critical defence related aspects. Many                                          state-of-the-art defence technologies such as drones, guided missiles, intelligence data collections, encrypted communications and                                          navigation would be limited or can become inoperable with functionally crippled satellite systems. Catalogues of space objects, generated and maintained by various space surveillance networks, are limited to larger objects,                                      typically of sizes greater than 10 cm in Low Earth Orbits (LEO, below about 2000 km altitude above the Earth) and greater                                      than 0.3 to 1 m at geosynchronous orbits (GEO, about 36000 km altitude above the Earth). There are even smaller debris with                                      high population density which cannot be tracked due to the limited observational capabilities. The sizes of the objects that                                      can be tracked depends on the observational systems and orbital altitude. US SPACE COMMAND (USPACECOM) currently tracks using Space surveillance tracking Network and catalogues more than 25,000 space                                      objects including debris and functional spacecraft in Earth’s Orbits. The number of debris that are too small to track are a                                      few millions. Changing scenario due to large constellation The outer space, at present, has more defunct objects than functional ones. The proposed large constellations are likely to                                      change the scenario completely. SpaceX plans to build a large constellation of nearly 12,000 satellites to provide worldwide, high bandwidth internet service.                                      The satellites within the constellation are planned to be deployed in different orbital shells of altitude around 550 km,                                      540-570 km, 335-345 km, and will be launched in batches. The full constellation is expected to be operational by 2027. In April                                      2020, SpaceX has also applied for a second generation of Starlink constellation comprising 30000 LEO satellites, the satellites                                      are proposed to be deployed in 8 orbital shells, within an altitude range of 328 to 641 km. In 2021, a total of 1712 payloads were launched. Among them, nearly 83% are contributed by the proposed constellations. SpaceX                                      is found to be the main contributor, followed by OneWeb, Flock, Lemur, SpaceBee.  The number of such satellites are increasing                                      rapidly due to increased applications of Communication and Earth Observation satellites and trend of manufacturing short-lived                                      satellite with commercial components en masse. The growing usage large constellation of satellites, the growth of private sector investment in space exploration, the on-orbit                                      breakup and collisions (like Iridium-Cosmos collision) and the anti-satellite testing leaving thousands of fragments in the orbits                                      are all contributing to the spurt in the space debris population. It is expected that number of operational satellites will surpass                                      the number of space debris by 2030. Consequently, the total number of space objects of more than 10 cm sized in LEO is expected to                                      be about 60000 by 2030. The present studies by Inter Agency Space Debris Coordination committee (IADC) and other study groups of space agencies show that the                                      collisional threats will continue to grow in the near future even after spacecraft owner/operators comply with the mitigation guidelines                                      including the ones on Post Mission Disposal put forward by IADC and United Nations.  Long-term growth in space debris leads to two major                                      risks; first, that space debris could potentially create unusable regions of orbit due to proliferation of debris objects and the associated                                      increase in collision risk due to the resultant congestion. Secondly, it may lead to “Kessler Syndrome”, a situation in which a collision in                                      space results in cascading collisions leading to the generation of more and more debris fragments, ultimately prohibiting meaningful use of                                      outer space. How to minimise collision threats? To minimise the collision threats posed by space debris, IADC brought out a set of Space Debris Mitigation Guidelines in 2002. Later in 2007,                                      the Scientific and Technical Subcommittee (STSC) of the United Nations' Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space (UNCOPUOS) adopted a                                      consensus set of space debris mitigation guidelines based on these IADC guidelines which was endorsed by the General Assembly of the United                                      Nations in late 2007. These guidelines describe the practices that have to be adopted for limiting the generation of space debris in the                                      environment. In order to limit the collision risk to spacecraft and also to contain proliferation of space debris environment, the guidelines                                      are to be considered for the mission planning, design, manufacture and operational (launch, mission and disposal) phases of spacecraft and launch                                      vehicle orbital stages. The guidelines typically cover on the topics such as limiting debris released during normal operations, minimising the                                      potential for break-ups during operational phases, limiting the probability of accidental collision in orbit, avoiding intentional destruction                                      and other harmful activities in space, minimising potential for post-mission break-ups resulting from stored energy, limit the long-term presence                                      of spacecraft and launch vehicle orbital stages in the Low Earth Orbit (LEO) region after the end of their mission and limit the long-term interference                                     of spacecraft and launch vehicle orbital stages with the Geosynchronous Orbit (GEO) region after the end of their mission. As a responsible space faring nation, India follows all the above guidelines in its space activities and complies with them to the maximum extent possible                                      and practicable under the constraints of national priorities, payload availability and mission operations. Observational facilities plays a key role Radar and optical telescopes are the main ground based facilities for tracking space objects including space debris. Accurate orbital information is a                                      pre-requisite for mitigating any collision threats to an operational space asset from other resident space objects. Presently orbital data available in                                      public domain lack the requisite accuracy leading to ambiguity in the decision making process pertinent to collision avoidance manoeuvres. Space faring                                      nations and private SSA entities have their own observational facilities to get more accurate orbital data and hence to avoid collision threats more                                      confidently. India has also progressed in establishing indigenous space object observational facilities through Multi Object Tracking Radar at SHAR                                      and few optical telescopes. In order to track closely and frequently the operational spacecraft and the threat objects for estimation of their positions                                      accurately, it is essential to have a network of observational facilities with wide geographical distribution. Space Situational Awareness (SSA) SSA deals with the comprehensive knowledge of the space environment, assessment of any threats to space activities and the implementation of necessary mitigation                                      measures to safeguard the space assets. SSA plays a crucial role in ensuring safe and sustainable space activities complying with domestic and international                                      guidelines, standards and other norms. Satellites orbiting the Earth being susceptible to collision from other space objects, it is essential to analyse the close approach of all space objects to detect                                      collision threats well in advance. Whenever a critical collision threat is identified for a spacecraft, an evasive manoeuvre known as Collision Avoidance manoeuvre                                      (CAM) needs to be performed to mitigate the collision risk.  The essentially global nature of space activities makes data sharing and collaboration very important                                      for SSA, especially in the context of collision avoidance.  Because, in case a close approach event involves two operational assets, exchange of relevant information                                      through coordination and collaboration between the concerned agencies helps to improve the accuracy of close approach analysis. Space Situational assessment for 2021 Global Scenario Space object population is found to be growing which is indicative of the ease of accessibility to space and varied applications of space technology in day-to-day life. Space object to Launch ratio is highest in 2021. In other words, more space objects are placed in orbit per launch. In 2020, for 522 objects were placed in space with 102                                              launches comparing to 1860 objects in 135 launches in 2021. In 2021, more than 60% of objects added to space are from large LEO satellite constellations, mostly from SpaceX                                              Starlink constellation. In 2021, Spacetrack has reported 4 on-orbit break-up events generating 150 fragment objects and 2 collision events producing 942 objects, including that of Russian ASAT test.                                              515 space objects re-entered the Earth’s atmosphere as a result of natural decay. Clearly, the space object population has increased by many folds in comparison to the reduction                                              through natural decay. Indian Scenario As on 1st January, 2022, India has 21 operational satellites in Low Earth Orbit (LEO) and 28 operational satellites in Geostationary Orbit. In 2021, ISRO carried out launch of one                                      PSLV-DL variant (PSLV-C51) mission and one GSLV-MkII variant (GSLV-F10) mission. GSLV-F10 could not accomplish the mission successfully. In 2021, India placed 5 satellites and 1 PSLV                                      rocket body (PS4 stage) in Low Earth Orbits. India placed 65 rocket bodies in orbit till date from the first launch, of which 42 are still in orbit around the Earth and 23 have re-entered and burnt up in the Earth’s atmosphere.                                      The break-up event of the 4th stage of PSLV-C3 in 2001 generated 386 debris of which 76 are still in orbit. Safeguarding Indian space assets from debris in 2021 ISRO regularly carries out close approach monitoring for all space objects with Indian Space assets.  ISRO monitored 4382 events with close approach distance less than 1 km to Indian LEO                                      space assets and 3148 close approach events less than 5 Km with GEO objects during the year 2021. The maximum number of threats objects were from fragments of Fengyun 1C (Chinese ASAT                                      test in 2007) and Cosmos – Iridium Collision. 84 close approaches less than 1 km were observed between Starlink satellites and Indian Space Assets. Combined Space Operations Centre of                                      USPACECOM issued 543 conjunction alerts regarding the close approaches to the Indian operational assets.  The number of alerts is expected to increase significantly in the coming years                                      with the increase in the number of space objects especially due to proliferation of the large satellite constellations. Collision avoidance manoeuvre needs to be carried out to avoid any critical close approach which might lead to collision. The number of such manoeuvres have increased significantly in                                          recent years. CAM is carried out by thrusting the satellite with the fuel stored in the spacecraft. Penalties incurred due to CAM include reduction in the lifetime of the spacecraft due                                          to fuel expenditure and disruption of payload operations.  The graph depicts the number of such manoeuvres carried out by ISRO over the last few years.  In 2021, ISRO carried out 19 CAMS,                                          out of which 14 were executed for LEO and 5 for GEO spacecraft. It can be seen that number of CAMS are going up year to year and the increasing trend is anticipated to be continued in                                          future with the unabated growth of the space object population. Spacecraft Decommissioning in 2021 In 2021, Chandrayaan-2 Orbiter (CH2O) and Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) of NASA were predicted to come critically close to each other in lunar orbit on 20 October, 2021. NASA and ISRO                                              agreed that the situation merited a collision avoidance manoeuvre which was executed by Chandrayaan-2 on 18th October, 2021, well before the conjunction Post Mission Disposal (PMD) was carried out for Cartosat-2, initially operating at a 630 km altitude circular orbit, through a series of apogee manoeuvres to lower its perigee altitude to 380 km                                             from. Hence, the post mission orbital lifetime of Cartosat-2, otherwise expected to be more than 30 years, has been now reduced to less than 5 years in full compliance with the IADC recommended                                             “25-year rule” on the post mission lifetime of LEO objects.The satellite is expected to be decommissioned in 2022. Prior to its decommissioning on 24 Jan 2022, INSAT-4B was raised to a super-synchronous graveyard orbit followed by passivation of propulsion and electrical systems in complete compliance with                                      the UN and IADC recommended post mission disposal guidelines for GEO objects. Way Ahead With the ever-increasing trend in the object population in outer space, it is imperative for all responsible space faring entities to limit the creation of space debris by conforming to space debris                                      mitigation guidelines.  Monitoring of space objects is an essential component for continual assessment of the space situation and devising appropriate mitigation strategies for space asset protection.                                       Towards this goal, space object observation capabilities need to be enhanced through the establishment of necessary infrastructure With the announced space reforms with private entities participation in space activities, India’s responsibility and the contributions in the long term sustainability of outer space need to be stressed.                                      Indian efforts in SSA is coordinated centrally at SSA Control Centre in Bengaluru and managed by the Directorate of Space Situational Awareness and Management in ISRO HQ. ISRO has taken up the establishment                                      of Space Surveillance and Tracking network with RADARS and Optical Telescopes under the project Network for Space Objects Tracking and Analysis (NETRA).  To analyse and assess the potential threats to operational                                      spacecraft and to attain self-reliance in safeguarding the valuable space assets, it is essential to augment and expand the network of observational facilities. In the context of the global implication of space-based activities, collaboration amongst international space agencies and entities also plays a key role in effective monitoring and mitigation of the space debris                                      environment."

Earth’s Moon features a surface-boundary-exosphere. For Moon,                                 different constituents in the exosphere are fed from the surface by a variety of                                 processes, such as thermal desorption, solar wind sputtering, photo-stimulated                                 desorption, and micrometeorite impact vaporization. The exospheric atoms may be lost to                                 space by the thermal escape (also known as the Jean’s escape). Also, the atoms get                                 ionized by photo-ionization and charge exchange with the solar wind ions. Subsequently,                                 they can be swept away by the convective electric field of the solar wind. Some of these                                 atoms/ions can also be deposited back on the lunar surface. Thus, the lunar exosphere                                 exists as a result of a dynamic equilibrium between several source and sink processes. Noble gases serve as important tracers to understand the processes of                                 surface-exosphere interaction, and Argon-40 (Ar-40) is such an important tracer atom to                                 study the dynamics of the lunar exospheric species. Ar-40 originates from the                                 radioactive disintegration of Potassium-40 (K-40) present below the lunar surface. Once                                 formed, it diffuses through the inter-granular space and makes way up to the lunar                                 exosphere through seepages and faults. The CHACE-2 observations provide the diurnal and spatial variation of                                 Ar-40 covering the equatorial and mid latitude regions of the Moon.  The uniqueness                                 of this result from Chandrayaan-2 mission lies in the fact that although Apollo-17 and                                 LADEE missions have detected the presence of Ar-40 in the lunar exosphere, the                                 measurements were confined to the near-equatorial region of the Moon. As there is a                                 steep latitudinal temperature gradient of the lunar surface, it was, so far, a gap area                                 to study the global dynamics of the lunar exospheric species, which is a                                 temperature-driven process.  In this context, the observations by CHACE-2 onboard                                 Chandrayaan-2 orbiter on Ar-40 up to the mid-latitude regions (−60º to +60º) play a                                 significant role to bridge the gap in the knowledge. CHACE-2 observations reveal an increase in the number density of                                 Ar-40                                 near the sunrise terminator, a decrease through the dayside, a secondary peak near                                 sunset terminator and a night-side minima. This is the typical behaviour of a                                 condensable gas. The variation of relative number density of Argon-40 for                                     different                                     solar longitudes in the near equatorial regions of the Moon observed by CHACE-2                                     (blue curve) compared with that of LACE/Apollo-17 observations (black curve) during                                     March 24 to April 7, 1973.Solar longitude of 0ºindicates the subsolar point (local solar time of 12 hr), 90ºrepresents the sunset terminator (local solar time of 18 hr), 180ºrepresents midnight (local solar time of 24 hr), and 270ºindicates the sunrise terminator (local solar time of 6 hr). The black                                     dotted curve for the solar longitudes 0º-90ºand                                     270º-360ºare from theoretical extrapolations                                     (Hodges & Hoffman, 1974). The enhancements in the relative number density of                                     Argon-40 during the sunrise and sunset terminators can be clearly seen. For the mid latitude regions, CHACE-2 observations showed for the                                         first time that the variation in the number density of Ar-40 with respect to solar                                         longitudes are similar to that of low latitude regions, despite the differences in                                         temperature and topography. Further, the CHACE-2 observations reveal that the distribution in                                         Ar-40 has significant spatial heterogeneity. There are localized enhancements (termed as                                         Argon bulge) over several regions including the KREEP (potassium (K), rare-earth                                         elements, and phosphorus (P)) and South Pole Aitken terrain. The observations of Argon bulge by CHACE-2 are indicative of unknown or additional loss processes, Moon quakes or                                         regions with lower activation energies, which call for a better understanding of the                                         surface-exosphere interactions and source distributions of Ar-40. CHACE-2 was a sequel to the CHACE experiment on the Moon Impact Probe                                             (MIP) of Chandrayaan-1 mission and also draws heritage from the Mars Exospheric Neutral                                             Composition Analyser (MENCA) experiment aboard the Indian Mars Orbiter Mission. The results are published in the journal ‘Geophysical Research                                             Letters’, doi: 10.1029/2021GL094970.

Certain regions with enhanced Ar-40 signal                                     are clearly seen"

The enormous distances involved in interplanetary missions present a                                 demanding challenge; developing and mastering the                                 technologies essential for these missions will open endless possibilities for space                                 exploration. After leaving Earth,                                 the Orbiter will have to endure the Interplanetary space for 300 days before Mars                                 capture. Apart from deep space communications and                                 navigation-guidance-control capabilities, the mission will require autonomy at the                                 spacecraft end to handle contingencies. Once India decided to go to Mars, ISRO had no time to lose as the nearest launch window                                 was only a few months away and it could not                                 afford to lose the chance, given the next launch would present itself after over 780                                 days, in 2016. Thus, mission planning, manufacturing                                 the spacecraft and the launch vehicle and readying the support systems took place                                 swiftly.

"event/Chandrayaan-2_detected_solar_proton_events_due_to_high_intensity_solar_flares_in_January_2022.","has_description","Chandrayaan-2 detected solar proton events due to high intensity solar flares in January 2022Home/Archives/Chandrayan Solar Flares When Sun is active, spectacular eruptions called solar flares occur that sometimes also spew out energetic particles                                              (called Solar Proton Events or SPEs) into interplanetary space. Most of these are high energy protons that impact space                                              systems and significantly increase radiation exposure to humans in space. They can cause ionisation on large scales in                                              Earth's middle atmosphere.  Many intense solar flares are accompanied by coronal mass ejections (CMEs), a powerful stream                                              of ionised material and magnetic fields, which reach Earth a few days later, leading to geomagnetic storms and lighting up                                              the polar sky with auroras. Solar flares are classified according to their strength.  The smallest ones are A-class, followed by B, C, M and X. Each letter                                              represents a 10-fold increase in energy output.  This means that an M class flare is ten times intense than C-class flare and 100                                              times intense than B-class flare. Within each letter class there is a finer scale from 1 to 9 i.e a M2 flare is twice the strength                                              of M1 flare. Recently, there were two M-class solar flares. One flare (M5.5) spewed out energetic particles into interplanetary space and the other                                                      flare (M1.5) was accompanied by a Coronal Mass Ejection (CME). SPE event was seen by NASA's Geostationary                                                      Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) satellite orbiting around Earth. However, the CME event was not detected by GOES. Chandrayaan-2 Large Area Soft X-ray Spectrometer (CLASS) on-board Chandrayaan-2 Orbiter detected SPE due to an M5.5 class solar flare that                                              occurred on January 20, 2022 (blue curve). The red curve shows the proton counts due to SPE recorded by GOES satellite operated by NOAA. CLASS instrument also detected CME event as it passed through the moon due to an M1.5 class solar flare that occurred on Jan 18. CME travels with a                                                      speed of about 1000 km/s and it takes about 2-3 days to reach Earth. The signature of this event is missed by GOES satellite, as Earth magnetic field                                                      provides shielding from such events. However, the event was recorded by Chandrayaan-2. Thus, CLASS payload on Chandrayaan-2 saw both the SPE and CME events pass by from two intense flares on the Sun.  Such multi point observations help us understand the propagation                                                      and its impact on different planetary systems. Shown in both graphs is the arrival rate of protons recorded by CLASS payload versus time (in UTC). Integral flux is defined as total number of protons above an energy                                                  (or within an energy range) per second per unit detector area. In the present case, energy of proton is greater than 11.6 MeV."

Space Applications Centre (SAC) and Physical Research                                                  Laboratory (PRL), both from the city of Ahmedabad, have jointly demonstrated quantum entanglement based real time Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) over 300m                                                  atmospheric channel along with quantum-secure text, image transmission and quantum-assisted two-way video calling. The demonstration was conducted at SAC,                                                  Ahmedabad, between two buildings separated by a distance of 300 m. This experiment and demonstration were repeated over several nights to ensure the                                                  repeatability and robustness of indigenously developed QKD system capable of seamlessly generating and utilizing secure keys for various applications. Shri. S. Somanath, Chairman, ISRO / Secretary, DOS has witnessed this live breakthrough demonstration at SAC, Ahmedabad.  Shri. Nilesh M Desai, Director SAC                                              and Dr. Anil Bhardwaj, Director PRL were also present during the demonstration. Various images were encrypted using generated quantum key and transmitted over                                              classical channel from one building to another building separated by 300m and decrypted at the receiving terminal in real time. This is yet another significant step towards the development of the planned Satellite Based Quantum Communication (SBQC). This feat comes after the earlier breakthrough                                              demonstration of quantum secure videoconferencing by SAC-ISRO using ‘prepare-and-measure’ quantum communication technology, in free space, over a distance of 300 m on                                              19 March 2021. In order to achieve this technology feat, scientists developed various key technologies like robust & high brightness entangled photon source (EPS), BBM92 protocol implementation,                                              NavIC enabled synchronization, polarization compensation technique etc. A cryptographic application software suite with integrated quantum security has also been developed and                                              demonstrated for text, image, video encryption/decryption. The BBM92 protocol based quantum communication link was demonstrated in the experiment. The secure-key-rate achieved was ~1.8 kbps, with Quantum Bit Error Rate (QBER) of less than                                              10%. Quantum entanglement was achieved with Bell’s parameter and quantum visibility greater than 2.2 and 80% respectively. With these developments, ISRO, Department of Space is getting ready for satellite based demonstrations of fundamental quantum mechanics experiments as well as quantum communication                                              for future-proof data security."

With regard to the Vikas engine qualification for the Gaganyaan Programme, two                                     engines have already undergone tests under nominal operating                                     conditions for a total duration of 480 seconds. The test carried out today is to verify the robustness of the engine by operating                                     beyond its nominal operating conditions (fuel-oxidiser ratio                                     and chamber pressure). The performance of the engine met the test objectives and the                                     engine parameters were closely matching with the predictions                                     during the entire duration of the test. Further, three more tests are planned for a cumulative duration of 75 seconds under                                     varying operating conditions. Subsequently, another high thrust                                     Vikas engine will undergo a long-duration test for 240 seconds to complete the Vikas                                     engine qualification for Gaganyaan Programme."

Over a span of one week                                             prior to the conjunction, analyses by both ISRO and JPL/NASA consistently                                             showed that the radial separation between the two spacecraft would be less                                             than 100 m and the closest approach distance would be only about 3 km at the                                             aforementioned time of closest approach. Both the agencies deemed that the                                             situation warranted a collision avoidance manoeuvre (CAM) to mitigate the                                             close approach risk, and it was mutually agreed that CH2O would undergo the                                             CAM. The manoeuvre was scheduled on 18th October 2021, it was designed to                                             ensure a sufficiently large radial separation at the next closest                                             conjunction between the two spacecraft. The CAM was executed nominally at                                             14:52 UTC (8:22 pm IST), on October 18th. After orbit determination of CH2O                                             with post-manoeuvre tracking data, it was reconfirmed that there would be no                                             further close conjunctions with LRO in the near future with the achieved                                             orbit. It may be noted that like CH2O, LRO orbits the Moon in a nearly polar orbit                                             and hence, both the spacecraft come close to each other over the Lunar                                             poles. It is common for satellites in Earth Orbit to undergo Collision                                             Avoidance Manoeuvres to mitigate collision risk due to space objects                                             including space debris and operational spacecraft. ISRO regularly monitors                                             such critical close approaches and execute CAMs for its operational                                             satellites whenever the collision risk is assessed to be critical. However,                                             this is the first time such a critically close conjunction was experienced                                             for a space exploration mission of ISRO which necessitated an evasive                                             manoeuvre. The event highlights the importance of continual assessment of close                                             approach situations for Lunar and Martian missions, and the fact that                                             effective mitigation of close approach risk involves close coordination and                                             synergy among different space agencies.

An Announcement of Opportunity has been floated in this regard, where interested agencies were invited to apply to become registered ISRO merchandisers. Addressing the gathering, Secretary, DOS/Chairman, ISRO Dr K Sivan said, “It makes me happy to see the immense interest the program has generated in such a short time. I am certain that the products created from your efforts shall reach nook and corner of the country including northeast states & Jammu & Kashmir and take the ISRO story among the youth and kids.” He also emphasized that the merchandise program has not been rolled out with a commercial interest, rather, the intent is outreach and creating awareness through common products such as toys, Do-it-Yourself kits, T-shirts, etc., which kindle curiosity and serve as reminiscence of ISRO success. He expressed hope that many more creative enterprises shall come forward to make use of this opportunity and create diverse products, highlighting ISRO’s previous and upcoming efforts, in a manner appealing to the younger generation, as we take the space program onwards and upwards.

"event/Unraveling_the_mysteries_of_the_Solar_Corona","has_description","Unraveling the mysteries of the Solar Corona: New results from                                 Chandrayaan-2 Solar X-ray MonitorHome/ Media/Archives/ Solar Corona-Solar X-ray Monitor Our Sun, being the primary source of energy for our solar system has a significant                                     influence on our lives, and has always instilled a curiosity in humankind.. Though                                     we have a fairly good understanding of the origin of energy and other various                                     aspects of the Sun, several potentially life-changing phenomena still remain a                                     mystery. Being the nearest star, understanding the Sun also allows us to learn about                                     other distant stars betterSome of these mysteries are related to the hot outer atmosphere of the Sun, known as                                     ‘corona’, which emits profusely in ultra-violet and X-ray wavelengths of the                                     electromagnetic spectrum. We know that the corona consists of ionized gas at                                     temperatures exceeding one million Kelvin, which is much higher than photospheric                                     temperature of 6000 K, the visible surface temperature of the Sun. However, this                                     observation is against the natural expectation that the temperatures should reduce                                     as we go away from the source of energy, and this is known as the ‘coronal heating                                     problem’. From observations, such as the presence of even hotter corona, called                                     active regions above the Sunspots (dark patches seen in visible images of the Sun)                                     where the magnetic fields are known to be stronger, it is suggested that the                                     magnetic fields have an important role in the coronal heating. While there are                                     different theories regarding the actual mechanism, one of these relies on the                                     occurrence of a large number of small solar flares called ‘nanoflares’. Another                                     puzzling observation about the corona is that certain elements are found to have                                     abundances three to four times higher in active regions than in the photosphere.                                     This happens for elements which are easier to ionize, or require lesser energy to                                     ionize. In more technical terms, these elements have their First Ionization                                     Potential (FIP) lower than 10 eV, and hence this phenomenon is generally termed as                                     ‘FIP bias’. The exact reason behind the FIP bias and its origin remains an open                                     question.A team of scientists from the Physical Research Laboratory (PRL), Ahmedabad, used                                     observations of the Sun in soft X-rays with Solar X-ray Monitor (XSM) onboard ISRO's                                     Chandrayaan-2 mission during the deepest solar minimum of the past hundred years to                                     learn exciting details about the solar corona. For the first time, absolute                                     abundances of elemental Mg, Al, Si in the quiet solar corona are derived. The team                                     discovered and characterized around 100 “sub-A class” microflares in the quiet                                     corona providing new insight into coronal heating puzzle.The XSM, designed and developed by PRL with support from various ISRO centres,                                     provides measurement of soft X-ray (1-15 keV) spectrum of the Sun. The XSM also                                     supports the quantitative measurements of elemental abundances of the lunar surface                                     using the companion payload CLASS (Chandrayaan-2 Large Area Soft X-ray Spectrometer)                                     developed by URSC, Bangalore, which measures the X-ray fluorescence spectrum from                                     the lunar surface. At present, XSM is the only instrument that provides soft X-ray                                     spectral measurements of the Sun, i.e., measures the intensity of X-ray in different                                     energies over the 1 to 15 keV. More importantly, XSM provides such measurements with                                     very good energy resolution at every second, the highest cadence for any instrument                                     so far.XSM started observations of the Sun in September 2019, during the period of solar                                     minimum when typically there were very few Sunspots and active regions on the Sun.                                     The solar minimum of 2019-2020 was even more peculiar as the Sun was extremely                                     quiet, and its activity was at the lowest level over the past century. This provided                                     a unique opportunity for XSM to observe the quiet corona without active regions for                                     long periods. The solar X-ray flux as observed by the XSM during this period is                                     shown in the figure. Intervals highlighted with blue color correspond to a period of                                     76 days when no active regions were present on the solar disk, and XSM was observing                                     the quiet corona.A remarkable and surprising observation is the detection of a large number (98) of                                     extremely small flares in the quiet corona (see Figure below). These flares are so                                     small that their intensity is well below the standard scale to classify solar flares                                     (i.e. A, B, C, M, and X class flares, where each class is 10 times more intense than                                     previous), and hence these are termed as “sub-A class microflares”. Using the X-ray                                     spectra of these microflares obtained with the XSM and contemporary images in                                     Extreme Ultra-violet obtained with the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) of NASA's                                     Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO), the energy content of these flares could be                                     estimated. This was the first observation and statistical study of such a large                                     sample of microflares in the quiet Sun, supporting the hypothesis of the presence of                                     even smaller scale flares everywhere on the solar corona that could be responsible                                     for the coronal heating.The X-ray emission over these 76 days, excluding the durations of the microflares,                                     is unusually constant. This is the lowest intensity of X-ray emission observed from                                     the Sun since space-borne observations began. Analysis of the XSM spectra of the                                     quiet Sun, excluding the microflares, provided the measurement of abundances of                                     various elements. The abundances of the low FIP elements Mg, Al, and Si were                                     estimated and found to be lower than the abundances seen in active region corona but                                     higher than that in the photosphere. This is the first report of measurement of                                     abundances as well as reduced FIP bias in the quiet Sun. Our observations of FIP                                     bias in the quiet Sun provides significant inputs towards understanding the FIP bias                                     and suggests that it arises due to the presence of Alfvén waves in the closed                                     magnetic loops.These outstanding science results on the solar corona and heliophysics obtained                                     during a unique solar extremely quiet period using a sensitive instrument XSM aboard                                     Chandryayaan-2 observations are published in two companion papers in the May issue                                     of the Astrophysical Journal Letters.Both the Chandrayaan-2 orbiter and the XSM instrument are performing extremely well,                                     and expected to provide many more exciting and new results. Figure : Panels (a) and (b) show the X-ray flux in the 1–15 keV energy range with a                                     time cadence of 120 seconds, as measured by the XSM during two observing seasons.                                     Different background shades represent activity levels on the Sun, with orange                                     representing periods when active regions are present; pink representing periods of                                     enhanced activity visible in both the XSM light curve as well as EUV/X-ray images                                     but not classified as Active Regions; and blue representing periods selected for the                                     present study when no major activity was observed on the Sun. The micro flares                                     detected during the quiet periods are marked with red points, representing their                                     peaks; and red vertical bars, representing their time.

This discovery                                         suggests that the building blocks of life could have polymerized not just on                                         Earth but on other planetary bodies through shock-processing of life-forming                                         molecules. The study also provides further experimental evidence for the                                         'threads' observed in meteorites being due to assemblages of (bio)molecules                                         arising from impact-induced shocks.The Origin of life remains a well-kept secret with one of the biggest questions and                                     greatest mysteries being “How and where did life start on Earth?”. The molecules                                     that are necessary for life are known to be present in the deeper, darker and the                                     colder regions of space. Simple molecules such as water, ammonia, carbon monoxide                                     and carbon dioxide, methane, nitrogen and oxygen, etc., are processed in the extreme                                     environments of deep space and are converted to larger and complex molecules, such                                     as the amino acids / nucleobases / fatty acids, so called the molecules of life,                                     that are necessary to make the protein, DNA and lipids, respectively, which are                                     basic ingredients of a living cell. Carl Sagan (and his co-workers) had shown that                                     applying shockwaves to such simple molecules can synthesize amino acids in an                                     instant. Instantaneous synthesis of such larger molecules by a shockwave is quite                                     surprising as the conversion of simple to complex molecules by the action of charged                                     particles such as electron, protons and ions takes a long time.In its early days - billions of years ago, many of the molecules formed in space are                                     thought to have been brought to Earth by cometary or asteroid impacts. During such                                     an impact event the kinetic energy of the incoming bolide is transferred to the                                     target momentarily creating extreme conditions that alter the physico-chemical                                     nature of both the target and the bolide. Shockwaves, of high intensity, generated                                     at the time of such impact events are capable of modifying the chemical nature of                                     not just the simple molecules but even the complex molecules, such as the molecules                                     of life, by providing the energy required to overcome thermochemical barriers and so                                     trigger more complex chemistry. Such high intensity shockwaves can be generated in                                     the laboratory and therefore, conditions experienced in an impact event can be                                     simulated in the laboratory.In order to understand the fate of the molecules of life in simulated impact induced                                     shock conditions, PRL scientists subjected a range of amino acids and nucleobases,                                     to high intensity shocks using a novel Material Shock Tube (MST)* facility of Indian                                     Institute of Science, Bangalore. A similar shock tube (High-Intensity Shock Tube for                                     Astrochemistry; HISTA) is established at the Physical Research Laboratory,                                     Ahmedabad. Both the shock tubes are similar in their design, and experiments were                                     carried out and repeated at both the shock tube facilities. These shock tubes can                                     generate shockwave speeds of up to Mach number ~5.6, temperature ~8000 K and dwell                                     time ~2 millisecond. Series of experiments were performed with individual and                                     mixture of amino acids (in powder form). We selected amino acids from among the set                                     of 21 amino acids that are found in the living systems. After the shock processing,                                     residue samples were collected at the end of the shock tube. Infrared spectroscopy                                     analysis showed the survivability of amino acids as well as additional band                                     corresponding to peptide bonds to be present in the shock processed sample. We                                     therefore used electron microscopy to image the residue sample.The results of the imaging analysis were quite remarkable. In the case of shock                                     processed glycine, we could see threads; flat and cylindrical, of length up to 100                                     micro-meter. In mixtures of amino acids, such as the four mixture; lysine - aspartic                                     acid - glutamic acid - arginine, we could see more complexity in the observed                                     structure (Figure 1). In the case of shock processing a mixture of many of the amino                                     acids (up to 20), we could observe the formation of twisted, threads that split /                                     combine and tube like structures. Whereas when subjecting nucleobases to similar                                     conditions we observed the thread formation, longer and twisted threads forming from                                     randomly oriented solid chunks of nucleobases (Figure 2). More details are provided                                     in two references provided below.Clearly there is a resemblance in the complex macroscale structures we see in the                                     shocked samples with those found in cellular structures. Similar structures have                                     also been reported to be present in some of the meteorites, although their origin                                     and exact nature, to-date, has been unknown.These experimental results clearly demonstrate that impact induced shock processes                                     can lead to complex macroscale structures in an instant, a natural selection                                     happening within few milliseconds and brings us a step further in our understanding                                     of the Origin of life from the molecules of life. Figure 1: Scanning electron micrographs of a mixture of four amino acids                                     (lysine-aspartic acid-arginine-glutamic acid) before and after shock processing. The                                     post shock sample showed the formation of a porous cylindrical structure. Depending                                     on the starting mixture of amino acids the resulting structure differed (see                                     reference 1 for details). Surendra V.

"event/ISRO_makes_breakthrough_demonstration_of_free-space_Quantum_Key_Distribution_(QKD)_over_300_m","has_description","ISRO makes breakthrough demonstration of free-space Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) over 300 mHome/ Media/Archives/Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) For the first time in the country, Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) has successfully demonstrated free-space Quantum Communication over a distance of 300 m. A number of key technologies were developed indigenously to accomplish this major feat, which included the use of indigenously developed NAVIC receiver for time synchronization between the transmitter and receiver modules, and gimbal mechanism systems instead of bulky large-aperture telescopes for optical alignment. The demonstration has included live videoconferencing using quantum-key-encrypted signals. This is a major milestone achievement for unconditionally secured satellite data communication using quantum technologies. The Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) technology underpins Quantum Communication technology that ensures unconditional data security by virtue of the principles of quantum mechanics, which is not possible with the conventional encryption systems. The conventional cryptosystems used for data-encryption rely on the complexity of mathematical algorithms, whereas the security offered by quantum communication is based on the laws of Physics. Therefore, quantum cryptography is considered as ‘future-proof’, since no future advancements in the computational power can break quantum-cryptosystem. The free-space QKD was demonstrated at Space Applications Centre (SAC), Ahmedabad, between two line-of-sight buildings within the campus. The experiment was performed at night, in order to ensure that there is no interference of the direct sunlight. The experiment is a major breakthrough towards ISRO’s goal of demonstrating Satellite Based Quantum Communication (SBQC), where ISRO is gearing up to demonstrate the technology between two Indian ground stations."

Notwithstanding                                                 this situation, huge quantity of work progressed in virtual mode in                                                 design and development of systems. Gaganyaan & Chandrayaan-3 major                                                 technical issues were addressed. The concept of virtual LCC and SCC got                                                 evolved and implemented. In fact, this mode of work appears to be more                                                 efficient and can be the new normal. Even where field work was involved,                                                 the activities were completed with minimum travel and social distancing.                                                 And thanks to the dedicated and hardworking personnel, who carried on                                                 the torch of progress and made sure that we complete two hugely                                                 successful launches by the end of the year. These achievements, even                                                 during hard times, in the face of financial & human resource                                                 constraints, is truly commendable and speaks volumes about the                                                 resourcefulness of team ISRO. This is also a year of change in the global space                                                 arena brought about by the participation of private players in all                                                 aspects of the space sector including launch vehicles and human                                                 spaceflight, which were hitherto the domain of Government space                                                 agencies. The situation is not different in our own country; for the                                                 first time in the history of this nation’s space programme, we have a                                                 handful of entrepreneurs who have come forward to develop end-to-end                                                 launch vehicles and satellites with the intention of providing                                                 space-based services and thereby contribute to the space economy. Having                                                 taken note of this transformation, the Government lost no time in                                                 announcing a series of initiatives in the space sector to provide policy                                                 support to such initiatives and thereby enable such players to co-exist                                                 and achieve commercial success. As part of the policy, the Government                                                 announced a dedicatedIndian National Space Promotion &                                                     Authorization Center(IN-SPACe), to promote and foster the                                                 Indian players in the space programme, to synergize the existing                                                 capabilities & facilities and also provide the essential                                                 authorization in compliance with national & international                                                 regulations. A precursor body for this Centre is already making all                                                 efforts to interface with 28 interested players in the country &                                                 processing applications, which would also put in place a seamless                                                 operating mechanism for IN-SPACe, as and when it becomes fully                                                 operational, which is expected to happen very shortly.

In the meanwhile, all the essential aspects of the overall space policy                                                 required to facilitate space system development & operation in the                                                 country including the specific satellite communication policy, remote                                                 sensing data policy, space transportation systems policy etc. are in the                                                 final draft stages in order to guide and support the implementation of                                                 the space sector reforms. Most importantly, the policy of unlocking the                                                 potential in the space sector is expected to foster innovation in this                                                 strategic sector towards further self-reliance and global leadership in                                                 space systems.With the expansion of space sector, the work of ISRO is going to                                                 increase with major focus on innovation and development. ISRO is a                                                 torch-bearer of innovation in the country, mainly due to the unique                                                 challenges with respect to the development, qualification and reliable                                                 operation of space systems in harsh space environments. We are all aware                                                 how the forefathers of the space programme like Prof. Sarabhai & Prof.                                                 Dhawan seeded the space programme, which has grown from                                                 strength-to-strength under their successors, purely based on the                                                 innovative execution & operationalization of the various space systems                                                 with concurrent indigenization. ISRO has also contributed toward the development of industry within the                                                 country and has empowered several MSMEs to thrive and contribute to the                                                 space programme. During the inauguration of the Indian Science Congress                                                 in January 2019, our Honourable Prime Minister had observed that our                                                 strengths in research and development are built on the backbone of our                                                 national laboratories, IISc, IITs, TIFR, Central Universities, etc. and                                                 called for the establishment of an expanded research ecosystem. The                                                 research and innovation investment in India is, at present, only 0.69%                                                 of GDP as compared to 2.8% in the United States of America, 4.3% in                                                 Israel and 4.2% in South Korea. Even we spend about 22% of the ISRO                                                 budget for R& D activities. The Government is also introducing ways and                                                 means to enhance the investment in research, considering the critical                                                 importance in research towards knowledge creation in the country. The                                                 whole nation looks up to ISRO as a leader of innovation and knowledge                                                 creation in the country and our activities in this decade should reflect                                                 the spirit of expanded research and technology development towards                                                 future capabilities. The last decade was a decade of many firsts in almost all the verticals                                                 of ISRO. To name a few, the operationalization of GSLV with indigenous                                                 cryogenic stage and GSLV MkIII, Mars Orbiter Mission, Astrosat, the                                                 NavIC constellation, heaviest high throughput satellite, and technology                                                 demonstration missions of winged body Reusable Launch Vehicle & Scramjet                                                 engine. When we are looking towards the next decade, we must be aware                                                 that globally, the space sector is facing disruption due to the entry of                                                 many private players, whose development efforts are targeted towards                                                 cost-effective space transportation systems andon-demand delivery of                                                 space-based services through satellite constellations. New paradigms in                                                 manufacturing as well as the advances made in Artificial Intelligence &                                                 Machine Learning are being maximally exploited to realize the next                                                 generation of space systems. 5G connectivity is at the horizon and the                                                 role of satellites in facilitating the 5G ecosystem as well as the                                                 Internet-of-Things (IoT) have been established.In line with global directions, we require to develop heavy lift launch                                                 vehicle, semi-cryogenic stage, reusable launch vehicle, advance                                                 propulsion, next generation avionics, advance materials, dynamic space                                                 applications and efficient integration of space based services as well                                                 as advanced space science missions.In this regard, every Centre of ISRO have been directed to work out a                                                 decadal plan, considering the expanded capabilities required in the                                                 short term as well as the long term. I am glad that all the ISRO                                                 Centres/Units have actively contributed to the formulation of the                                                 decadal plan provides ample focus on research & innovation, considering                                                 the national requirements, the new space policy, as well as the                                                 transitions occurring in the global space arena. In this decade: VSSC, the lead centre for space                                                 transportation systems, will carry forward its competence in launch                                                 vehicle development towards heavy lift capabilities, achieving partial                                                 & full reusability and achieving progress in scramjet engine                                                 research. All these developments require inter-disciplinary research and                                                 development in many areas including aeronautics, structures, propulsion,                                                 avionics, chemicals & materials. LPSC, the lead centre for liquid                                                 propulsion systems, will fructify the much-awaited high thrust                                                 semicryogenic propulsion capability, which is expected to boost our GTO                                                 (Geosynchronous Transfer Orbit) payload capability to almost 5.5 tonnes                                                 while also focusing on LOX/Methane propulsion, Green propulsion as well                                                 as electric propulsion. URSC, our lead centre for satellites,                                                 have got the tremendous challenge of developing & demonstrating new                                                 in-orbit technologies meeting the expanding requirements of India’s                                                 space infrastructure. In the next decade, emphasis will be on satellite                                                 constellation for broadband communication, all electric satellite                                                 platform and high performance satellite platforms in all the application                                                 areas. SACwill ensure the new technology                                                 payloads and also complete its indigenization efforts for the indigenous                                                 Atomic Clock and TWTA. In this decade, SAC &NRSCneed to work towards ensuring the collection, processing and on-demand                                                 delivery of satellite data services in line with user expectations. SDSCwill witness the scaling up of                                                 the launch infrastructure to support human spaceflight as well as new                                                 heavy lift vehicles and perhaps support & facilitate the launching                                                 of private space transportation systems in the country. IPRCneeds to gear up its test                                                 facilities to support the qualification of the new propulsion systems                                                 and also expand its integration facilities to realize the new                                                 semicryogenic & LOX/Methane stages. IISUwill realize the                                                 state-of-the-art inertial systems for the planned missions but also                                                 scale up its capabilities to support the space science & exploration                                                 missions in the decade. LEOSwill realize the                                                 state-of-the-art electro-optic sensors and optics for remote sensing                                                 cameras, radiometers, star sensor, optical filter, optical masks, IR                                                 detectors and MEMS based inclinometer., ISTRACandMCFwill                                                 upgrade the ground systems to meet the future requirements including                                                 that of human space flight. IIRS, DECUandIISTwill have to play a greater role in human resource development and                                                 outreach activities keeping in line with the dynamics of space sector. PRL, NARLandNE-SACwill have to cater to the scientific aspirations of new India in the                                                 next decade, where the society will transform from economic societies to                                                 knowledge based societies. SCLwill works towards creating a                                                 strong microelectronics base in the country and enhance capabilities in                                                 Very Large Scale Integrated circuit (VLSI) domain. A lion’s share of ISRO’s technology development &                                                 advanced R & D activities is expected to be carried out for                                                 facilitating the Gaganyaan programme and sustaining the human                                                 spaceflight activities in the long term. HSFC, in association will all ISRO                                                 Centre/Units, are working towards the enhanced capabilities essential                                                 for the human spaceflight programme including the human rated launch                                                 vehicle, Orbital Module, rendezvous & docking, regenerative life                                                 support systems and space habitats. This decade is going to be highly promising and                                                 challenging for the Indian Space Programme if we consider the distinct                                                 challenge of expanding our research footprint while also handling the                                                 transition towards the technology transfer & implementation of a                                                 more demand-driven operational launch vehicle & satellite programmes                                                 by ourPublic Sector Enterprises (PSE)and industry. In the short term, we have diverse missions to be                                                 achieved including the first developmental flight of the Small Satellite                                                 Launch Vehicle (SSLV), operational Geo-Imaging capability,                                                 Chandrayaan-3, the first solar mission, Aditya-L1, and the first Indian                                                 Data Relay Satellite. The first unmanned flight under the Gaganyaan                                                 Programme is another significant milestone to be achieved this year. In spite of a nationwide lockdown extending over a few                                                 months in 2020, I was pleasantly surprised at the way ISRO rose to the                                                 occasion and worked, employing all resources at its disposal to achieve                                                 a firm foundation for the next decade. Those months were effectively                                                 utilized as a period of introspection and planning to review the R &                                                 D and technology development in the individual Centres& units along                                                 with the formulation of the individual decadal plans. I take this opportunity to express my heartiest                                                 appreciation to each one of you for your hard work even during difficult                                                 times & keep the ISRO flag flying high. I wish you and your family                                                 members a New Year full of happiness, hope and prosperity and also a                                                 great decade, when every one of you shall fulfil their dreams and                                                 aspirations.

"event/Chandrayaan-2_Mission","has_description","Chandrayaan-2 Mission : Initial data releaseHome/Archives/Chandrayaan-2 Mission India’s second mission to the Moon, Chandrayaan-2 was launched on 22nd July 2019 from Satish Dhawan Space Center, Sriharikota. The Orbiter which was injected into a lunar orbit on 2nd Sept 2019, carries 8 experiments to address many open questions on lunar science. All experiments have been performing well and the data received, suggests excellent capability to deliver on the pre-launch promises. In the period since launch payload teams tuned onboard systems for optimal instrument configurations, derived essential in-flight calibration data, revised / updated data processing steps / software and have started to publish early results. Today, the first set of data are being released for all users. The public release data archived at the Indian Space Science Data Center in Bylalu, near Bengaluru is prepared in the standard, globally followed Planetary Data System 4 (PDS4) format for public release. Indian Space Science Data Center (ISSDC) is the nodal center of planetary data archive for planetary missions of ISRO. The Chandrayaan-2 data are required to be in Planetary Data Sysytem-4 (PDS4) standard and required to be peer reviewed scientifically and technically before acceptance as PDS archives and declared ready for sharing with global scientific community and general public. This activity has been completed and hence the first set of data from the Chandrayaan-2 mission are now being released for wider public use through the PRADAN portal hosted by ISSDC.  Users may also visit https://www.issdc.gov.in for more information about mission."

The virtual Industry Dialogue was organized to keep abreast the satcom industry of therecent decision of the Government of India to open the space sector to non-government & private Industry and also to obtain industry feedback and expectations for the promotion of the satcom activities in the country. While explaining the scenario in which the extant Satcom Policy-1997 was put in force, Dr Sivan stated that the satcom policy along with norms, guidelines and procedures (NGP) are being revised. The revision is required considering the rapid growth in satcom technology and expanded services in India and recognizing that the Space is the forth frontier for humanity and country’s security. He also emphasized that it is important to rope in the non-government private entities in the space sector so as to leverage the experience and expertise of the Indian Industry in realizing the satellite sub-systems, assembly, integration & testing and a vast experience of service sector in taking the satcom technology to the end users. The private enterprises bring in funds, talent and speed in the activities, and it would be a win-win situation for all if the space sector is also opened up for the private Industry.

"event/India's_AstroSat_discovers_one_of_the_earliest_galaxies_in_extreme-Ultraviolet_light_and_marks_a_major_breakthrough","has_description","India's AstroSat discovers one of the earliest galaxies in extreme-Ultraviolet light and marks a major breakthroughHome/India's AstroSat discovers one of the earliest galaxies India’s first multi-wavelength satellite, which has five unique X-ray and ultraviolet telescopes working in tandem, AstroSat, has detected extreme-UV light from a galaxy, called AUDFs01, 9.3 billion light-years away from Earth.                                                 The discovery was made by an international team of astronomers led by Dr. Kanak Saha, at the Inter-University Centre for Astronomy and Astrophysics (IUCAA), Pune and reported in Nature Astronomy.  This team includes scientists from India, Switzerland, France, The USA, Japan and The Netherlands.                                                 After the Big Bang, the Universe was a hot soup of particles (i.e., protons, neutrons, and electrons). As the universe started to cool, the protons and neutrons began combining into ionized atoms of hydrogen (and eventually some helium). These ionized atoms of hydrogen and helium combined with electrons to become neutral atoms — which allowed light to travel freely for the first time, since this light was no longer scattered off free electrons. The universe was no longer opaque! But there were no stars, and no galaxies, and the Universe was still dark. A few hundred million years after the big bang, the first stars and galaxies formed and the energy/photons pouring out from them ionized the hydrogen and helium again to protons and electrons. This is era is generally called as the epoch of reionization.                                                 Dr. Saha and his team observed the galaxy which is located in the Hubble Extreme Deep field, through AstroSat. Since UV radiation is absorbed by Earth’s atmosphere, it can only be observed from Space.   “AstroSat/UVIT was able to achieve this unique feat because the background noise in the UVIT detector is much less than the ones on Hubble Space Telescope”, said Dr. Saha. “The excellent spatial resolution, and high sensitivity, a tribute to the hard work of UVIT core team over a decade, were key to the detection of this very weak source”, said Prof. Tandon.Astronomers have been looking for sources that reionized the early universe. The usual suspects have been the first astronomical objects, especially the newborn small galaxies. But observing ionizing radiation from these sources is next to impossible. The probability that a fraction of extreme-UV photons escape the host galaxy and caught by a telescope on Earth is practically zero, because these photons will be absorbed by the gas in the galaxy or the gas surrounding the galaxy or the matter between the galaxy and us.But how some of these high energy photons manage to cross all the barriers and reach Earth is a mystery. The absorption in the intergalactic medium is so severe that it is impossible to observe ionizing photons in the reionization epoch directly. In the later epoch, the intergalactic absorbers decrease and we have a chance to detect such photons but it is still like a lottery, — said coauthor Dr. Akio Inoue, professor of  Waseda University, Japan.                                                                                                  With UVIT observation, AUDFs01 became the first example of a galaxy with clumpy morphology and leaking ionizing radiation at 60 nanometers. AUDFs01 offers the first observational constraint in this extreme ultraviolet regime where stellar models are the most discrepant; with further detections, AstroSat will allow us to refine our scenario of cosmic reionization — said co-author, Dr. Anne Verhamme, professor at the Geneva Observatory, Switzerland.                                                                                                  AUDFs01 is in the middle of a redshift range (0.4 to 2.5) where previously no similar sources were detected. The galaxy is not only bridging the gap between the low and high redshift regime at present, but it is also the beginning of a new exploration of star-forming galaxies at extreme-UV wavelength. One can use large-aperture, ground-based telescopes like Keck, VLT, and Subaru for observations of ionizing photons in the universe of redshift larger than 2.5. But below this redshift, AstroSat becomes a unique facility. “Indeed, UVIT will play an important role in revealing insights to the epoch of reionization”, said co-author Dr. Abhishek Paswan, a postdoctoral fellow at IUCAA. Anshuman Borgohain, a PhD student at Tezpur University and coauthor, said “It is a privilege to be a part of the team which has made this important discovery. The fact that we can do such outstanding work using Indian facilities is an inspiration for young scientists of the country”.                                                                                                  Dr Somak Raychaudhury, Director of IUCAA, said “this is a very important clue to how the dark ages of the Universe ended and there was light in the Universe. We need to know when this started, but it has been very hard to find the earliest sources of light. I am very proud that my colleagues have made such an important discovery.”                                                                                                  Dr. Saha from IUCAA who led this research said, “We knew it would be an uphill task to convince the international community that UVIT has recorded extreme-UV emission from this galaxy when more powerful HST has not.” This discovery of AUDFs01 by AstroSat establishes that there is hope and perhaps, this is the beginning.

Mare Serenitatis, which host the Sarabhai crater is one of the lunar mare region on the Moon, with vast lava plains creating a near flat surface. To the east and ~250-300 km of Sarabhai crater is the landing site of Apollo 17 and Luna 21 missions.Sarabhai crater is named after an Indian astrophysicist Dr. Vikram Ambalal Sarabhai, regarded as the Father of Indian Space program, and the Founder of Physical Research Laboratory and a distinguished cosmic-ray and space scientist. The birth centenary of Dr. Sarabhai is being celebrated by ISRO. The Digital Elevation Model (DEM) and 3D view of the crater generated using the Fore, Nadir and Aft images from TMC-2 reveals average depth of the crater as ~1.7 km from the raised crater rim and average slope of the crater walls is in the range 25-30°. This Sarabhai crater outer region is dominated by numerous smaller craters of varying diameter distributed over the flat Mare plains, and is devoid of any large crater (diameter >10 km) in its vicinity (~100 km around).  The raised rim, the gradient inner walls and the small hummocky floor makes the Sarabhai crater an excellent example to understand the impact processes on the lava filled region of the Moon."

"event/Detection_of_Argon-40_in_the_lunar_exosphere","has_description","Detection of Argon-40 in the lunar exosphereHome/Archives/Detection of Argon-40 Planetary scientists prefer to call the thin gaseous envelope around the Moon as the ‘Lunar exosphere’ since it is so tenuous that the gas atoms very rarely collide with each other. While the Earth’s atmosphere near the mean sea level contains ~1019 atoms in a cubic centimetre of volume, the lunar exosphere contains ~ 104 to 106atoms in a cubic centimetre. Argon-40 (40Ar), which is one of the isotopes of the noble gas Argon, is an important constituent of the lunar exosphere. It originates from the radioactive disintegration of Potassium-40 (40K), which has a half-life of ~1.2 X 109 years. The radioactive 40K nuclide, which is present deep below the lunar surface, disintegrates to 40Ar, which, in turn, diffuses through the intergranular space and makes way up to the lunar exosphere through seepages and faults The Chandra's Atmospheric Composition Explorer-2 (CHACE-2) payload aboard the Chandrayaan-2 orbiter, is a neutral mass spectrometer-based payload which can detect constituents in the lunar neutral exosphere in the range of 1-300 amu (atomic mass unit). As part of its early operation, it has detected 40Ar in the lunar exosphere from an altitude of ~100 km, capturing the day-night variations of concentration. 40Ar being a condensable gas at the temperatures and pressures that prevail on the lunar surface, condenses during lunar night. After lunar dawn, the 40Ar starts getting released to the lunar exosphere (blue shaded region in figure). Variation of Argon-40 observed during one orbit of Chandrayaan-2 during dayside and nightside of the Moon. The observed partial pressure has to be refined for the background and other effects to infer the density of lunar exospheric argon. The observations when Chandrayaan-2 was on the nightside is indicated by the black solid rectangle at the top of the panel and the two vertical dashed lines. Being in a polar orbit, Chandrayaan-2 enters the dayside of the Moon crossing the north pole, traverses through the dayside and enters the nightside after crossing the southpole."

This has resulted in the formation of innumerable                                                 impact craters that form the most distinct geographic features on its                                                 surface. Impact craters are approximately circular depressions on the                                                 surface of the moon, ranging from small, simple, bowl-shaped depressions                                                 to large, complex, multi-ringed impact basins. In contrast to volcanic                                                 craters, which result from explosion or internal collapse, impact                                                 craters typically have raised rims and floors that are lower in                                                 elevation than the surrounding terrain. The study of the nature, size,                                                 distribution and composition of impact craters and associated ejecta                                                 features reveal valuable information about the origin and evolution of                                                 craters. Weathering processes result in many of the crater physical                                                 features and ejecta material get covered by layers of regolith, making                                                 some of them undetectable using optical cameras. Synthetic Aperture                                                 Radar (SAR) is a powerful remote sensing instrument for studying                                                 planetary surfaces and subsurface due to the ability of the radar signal                                                 to penetrate the surface. It is also sensitive to the roughness,                                                 structure and composition of the surface material and the buried                                                 terrain. Previous lunar-orbiting SAR systems such as the S-band                                                 hybrid-polarimetric SAR on ISRO’s Chandrayaan-1 and the S & X-band                                                 hybrid-polarimetric SAR on NASA’s LRO, provided valuable data on the                                                 scattering characterisation of ejecta materials of lunar impact craters.                                                 However, L & S band SAR on Chandraayan-2 is designed to produce greater                                                 details about the morphology and ejecta materials of impact craters due                                                 to its ability of imaging with higher resolution (2 - 75m slant range)                                                 and full-polarimetric modes in standalone as well as joint modes in S                                                 and L-band with wide range of incidence angle coverage (9.5° - 35°). In                                                 addition, the greater depth of penetration of L-band (3-5 meters)                                                 enables probing the buried terrain at greater depths. The L & S band SAR                                                 payload helps in unambiguously identifying and quantitatively estimating                                                 the lunar polar water-ice in permanently shadowed regions. A convenient approach towards discerning the radar information is to                                                 prepare images using two derived parameters, ‘m’ the degree of                                                 polarization and ‘δ’ the relative phase between the transmit-receive                                                 polarized signals. These parameters are used to generate colour                                                 composite images with ‘even-bounce’, ‘volume or diffused’ and                                                 ‘odd-bounce’ scatterings of a pixel represented in red (R), green(G),                                                 and blue (B) image planes, respectively. The genesis of the scattering                                                 mechanism is as illustrated in Figure 1. Figure 2 is one of the m- δ decomposition images from the first datasets                                                 acquired over lunar south polar regions in L-band high-resolution                                                 (2mslant-range resolution) hybrid polarimetric mode. It is important to                                                 note that the obtained resolution is one-order better than the earlier                                                 best by a lunar-radar. This image presents many interesting facts about                                                 the secondary craters of different ages and origins in the lunar south                                                 polar region. The yellowish tone around crater rims in the image shows                                                 ejecta fields. The distribution of ejecta fields, whether uniformly                                                 distributed in all directions or oriented towards a particular side of a                                                 crater, indicates the nature of the impact. The image shows craters of                                                 vertical impact and oblique impact on the top-right and bottom-right,                                                 respectively. Similarly, the roughness of the ejecta materials                                                 associated with the impact craters indicates the degree of weathering a                                                 crater has undergone. Three similar sized craters along a row on the                                                 bottom-right of the image show examples of young crater, moderately                                                 weathered crater and an old degraded crater. Many of the ejecta fields                                                 seen in the image are not visible in high-resolution optical image over                                                 the same region, indicating the ejecta fields are buried beneath                                                 regolith layers. Chandrayaan-2 Orbiter’s DF-SAR has been operated in full-polarimetry                                                 mode- a gold standard in SAR polarimetry, and is the first-ever by any                                                 planetary SAR instrument. Figure 3 shows an L-band fully-polarimetric,                                                 20m slant-range resolution image of Pitiscus-T crater. The image is a                                                 colour composite of different transmit-receive polarization responses of                                                 the imaged region."

It uses a grating to split and disperse the reflected sunlight (and emitted component) into different spectral bands. The major objective of IIRS is to understand the origin and evolution of the Moon in a geologic context by mapping the lunar surface mineral and volatile composition using signatures in the reflected solar spectrum. The first illuminated image of the lunar surface was acquired by IIRS. The image covers part of the lunar farside in the northern hemisphere. Few prominent craters are seen in the image (Sommerfield, Stebbins and Kirkwood). Preliminary analysis suggests that IIRS could successfully measure the variations in the reflected solar radiation that bounces off the lunar surface from different kinds of surface types, namely, crater central peaks (e.g., Stebbins), crater floors (e.g., Stebbins and Sommerfield), very fresh reworked ejecta associated with small craterlets within the crater floor of a large crater (e.g., Sommerfield) and also the sun-illuminated inner rims of craters (e.g., Kirkwood). The variations in the spectral radiance are primarily due to the mineralogical/compositional variations that exist in the lunar surface and also due to the effect of space weathering. More detailed analysis that follows, is expected to yield important results on the heterogeneity of lunar surface composition."

"event/Solar_flare_observed_by_the_Solar_X-ray_Monitor_on_Chandrayaan-2","has_description","Solar flare observed by the Solar X-ray Monitor on Chandrayaan-2Home/Archives/Solar X-ray Monitor on Chandrayaan-2 Many violent phenomena continuously keep occurring on surface of the Sun                                                 and its atmosphere known as the corona. This solar activity follows an                                                 eleven-year cycle, which means, it goes through its 'solar maxima' and                                                 'solar minima' once every eleven years. While the cumulative emission of                                                 solar X-rays emitted over a year varies with the solar cycle, these are                                                 often punctuated with extremely large x-ray intensity variations over                                                 very short periods, few minutes to hours. Such episodes are known as                                                 solar flares. Chandrayaan-2 orbiter utilizes X-rays emitted by the Sun in a clever way                                                 to study elements on the lunar surface. Solar X-rays excite atoms of                                                 constituent elements on the lunar surface. These atoms when de-excited                                                 emit their characteristic X-rays (a fingerprint of each atom). By                                                 detecting these characteristic X-rays, it becomes possible to identify                                                 various major elements of the lunar surface. However, in order to                                                 determine their concentration, it is essential to have simultaneous                                                 knowledge of the incident solar X-ray spectrum. The Chandrayaan-2 orbiter carries two instruments, Chandrayaan 2 Large                                                 Area Soft X-ray Spectrometer (CLASS) and Solar X-ray Monitor (XSM), to                                                 measure the lunar elemental composition using this technique. Here, the                                                 CLASS payload detects the characteristic lines from the lunar surface                                                 and the XSM payload simultaneously measures the solar X-ray spectrum. Currently, the solar cycle is heading towards minima and the Sun has                                                 been extremely quiet for past few months. On 30th September 2019 00:00                                                 UTC - 1st October 2019 23:59 UTC, a series of small flares were observed                                                 by XSM. The figure shows the solar X-ray flux as measured by XSM (in blue)                                                 during this period, and for comparison, the flux measured by X-ray                                                 sensor on the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite                                                 (GOES-15) is also shown (in orange), which is considered the standard                                                 for solar X-ray intensity measurement.It shows that XSM is able to                                                 detect the intensity variations of the Sun much beyond the sensitivity                                                 limit of GOES. The gaps seen in GOES light curve around 09:00 UTC are                                                 due to instrumental artifacts. The GOES data was obtained from the                                                 National Center for Environmental Information of National Oceanic and                                                 Atmospheric Administration, USA. Apart from the better sensitivity, XSM also measures the spectrum of                                                 solar X-ray in the energy range of 1 - 15 keV with highest energy                                                 resolution so far for any broadband solar X-ray spectrometer over                                                 intervals as short as 1 second. Although this solar flare observed at present may not enable the study                                                 of the lunar surface composition due to the large angle between Sun,                                                 lunar surface and Chandrayaan-2 (close to 90 deg in this case against a                                                 desirable low value, close to zero), such XSM observations provide very                                                 useful data to understand various processes on the Sun."

The solar wind plasma                                                 which has charged particles embedded in the extended magnetic field of                                                 the Sun, moves at speeds of a few hundred km per second. It interacts                                                 with solar system bodies including Earth and its moon. Since the Earth                                                 has a global magnetic field, it obstructs the solar wind plasma and this                                                 interaction results in the formation of a magnetic envelope around                                                 Earth, called the magnetosphere. The Earth’s magnetosphere is compressed into a region approximately                                                 three to four times the Earth radius (~22000 km above the surface) on                                                 the side facing the Sun, but is stretched into a long tail (geotail) on                                                 the opposite side that goes beyond the orbit of Moon. Approximately,                                                 once every 29 days, Moon traverses the geotail for about 6 days centered                                                 around full moon. Thus Chandrayaan-2 also crosses this geotail and its                                                 instruments can study properties of geotail at a few hundred thousand                                                 kilometers from Earth. The CLASS instrument on Chandrayaan-2 is designed to detect direct                                                 signatures of elements present in the lunar soil. This is best observed                                                 when a solar flare on the Sun provides a rich source of x-rays to                                                 illuminate the lunar surface; secondary x-ray emission resulting from                                                 this can be detected by CLASS to directly detect the presence of key                                                 elements like Na, Ca, Al, Si, Ti and Fe. While this kind of “flash photography” requires one to await an                                                 opportune time for Sun to be active, CLASS in its first few days of                                                 observation, could detect charged particles and its intensity variations                                                 during its first passage through the geotail during Sept. The figure shows the change in intensity of particle events (believed to                                                 be mostly electrons), sometimes as much as 10 times the levels outside                                                 the geotail, indicating complex interplay with the magnetic field. More detailed studies in future along with observations from other space                                                 missions, will enable a multi-point study, essential to unravel the                                                 “dance of electrons to the music of magnetic fields” around Moon."

Since the launch of Chandrayaan-2 on July 22, 2019, not only India but the whole world watched its progress from one phase to the next with great expectations and excitement. This was a unique mission which aimed at studying not just one area of the Moon but all the areas combining  the exosphere, the surface as well as the sub-surface of the moon in a single mission. The Orbiter has already been placed in its intended orbit around the Moon and shall enrich our understanding of the moon’s evolution and mapping of the minerals and water molecules in the Polar Regions, using its eight state-of-the-art scientific instruments. The Orbiter camera is the highest resolution camera (0.3m) in any lunar mission so far and shall provide high resolution images which will be immensely useful to the global scientific community. The precise launch and mission management has ensured a long life of almost 7 years instead of the planned one year. The Vikram Lander followed the planned descent trajectory from its orbit of 35 km to just below 2 km above the surface. All the systems and sensors of the Lander functioned excellently until this point and proved many new technologies such as variable thrust propulsion technology used in the Lander. The success criteria was defined for each and every phase of the mission and till date 90 to 95% of the mission objectives have been accomplished and will continue contribute to Lunar science , notwithstanding the loss of communication with the Lander."

Space Situational Awareness & Management (SSAM) has become an internationally significant area due to the ever growing manmade space debris population and the increased collision threat with operational spacecraft.                                                         Chairman, ISRO laid foundation stone for Space Situational Awareness Control Centre at Peenya, Bengaluru on 2nd August, which is an important milestone in the progress of ISRO. ISRO has taken special attention to this aspect. ISRO has set up a Directorate of Space Situational Awareness and Management aiming at protecting high valued space assets from space debris close approaches and collisions. To carryout systematically all activities related to SSAM, a control centre is being established at Bengaluru. The Control Centre would facilitate the intensified activities foreseen for SSAM, in view of increasing debris population and operational space assets. The control centre would host a range of activities pertaining to protection of Indian Space assets from inactive satellites, pieces of orbiting objects, near earth asteroids and adverse space weather conditions. It would assimilate the tracking data of inactive satellites from indigenous observation facilities and generates useful information from bare observations through analysis. For sustainable use of space, the control centre would enable research activities pertaining to active debris removal, space debris modelling and mitigation."

"event/AstroSat_Picture_of_the_Month_of_March,2019","has_description","AstroSat Picture of the Month of March, 2019Home/Archives/Astrosat Picture A star relives its youth while dancing with its wizened companion in NGC 5466 This month we bring you yet anotherGlobular Cluster,NGC 5466, located around 52000 light years from us in theconstellation Bootes. However, we are going to turn our attention away from the cluster itself, and look at one particular star. This star, called NH 84, is a very special kind of star, and is what astronomers call aBlue Straggler Star, or BSS. Why are these special and how does it relive its youth? If you have read our previous APOMs on Globular Clusters , you may remember that almost all stars in a cluster are born together at the same time. You may also recall thatstarsare born, live sedately for a long time, and then die in various spectacular ways. The more massive a star is, the faster it will evolve, and the faster it will die. More massive stars are also usually bluer and hotter, whereas less massive stars areredder and cooler. If we start with a bunch of stars that are born at the same time, like in a Globular Cluster, then as time goes by, we expect to see less and less hot blue stars, since they would have died already. Instead, we would only see the cooler, redder and older stars. Which is why astronomers were very surprised when, in 1953, Allan Sandage found young hot blue stars in old star clusters. How did these stars retain their youth in the face of time? The answer was very surprising indeed, and involved two stars instead of one. The most common way this happens is in binary star systems, i.e., two stars orbiting each other. Snehalata Sahu of the Indian Institute of Astrophysics and her colleagues imaged the cluster NGC 5466 using the UltraViolet Imaging Telescope on AstroSat and identified many Blue Straggler Stars. In particular, they looked at one of them, NH 84, carefully and discovered that it had to be such a binary system. The bright star was a BSS which had swallowed up material from its companion star, and become more massive and bluer, reliving its youth. The poor companion, though, continued on to become a very hot and dense White Dwarf. How did these astronomers know that the companion is a White Dwarf? They deduced this based on the brightness of NH 84 that they measured in the ultraviolet wavelengths, which is where the White Dwarf shines the most. The BSS itself has a surface temperature of 8000 Kelvin, is about as massive as our Sun, and about 45% bigger. The White Dwarf, on the other hand, is 32000 Kelvin, is about half as massive as our Sun, but only 2% of its size! This is only the second such BSS–White Dwarf pair that astronomers have found in Globular Clusters. Recently, another team led by Subramaniam haddiscovered, using the UVIT, another binary system where a BSS was orbiting an evolved aged star whose youth it had stolen. This latest discovery was possible because of the superior resolution and sensitivity of AstroSat in the ultraviolet. The authors are now chasing after the other Blue Straggler Stars in this cluster. Let us wait and see what discoveries await them. The paper describing the results is accepted for publication by the Astrophysical Journal and can befound here. The accompanying science story, through India Science Wire, ishere."

It has kindled a natural curiosity and ever increasing interest in every individual, towards the Indian Space Program. In order to spread awareness about the benefits of space technology, ISRO is carrying out number of outreach activities. These activities are designed to address the people of every strata of our society. In addition, ISRO also accommodates a limited number of visitors to witness launch from the space port of India, which is insignificant compared to the demand today. In order to cater this ever increasing demand for witnessing rocket launches, ISRO has come out with a visitor’s gallery at Satish Dhawan Space Centre, Sriharikota. In the first phase, 5,000 capacity Launch Viewing Gallery is constructed in the form of a stadium, and placed at an appropriate location with clear line of sight to the two launch pads of the Sriharikota Range. This facility is going to be inaugurated on 31st March 2019 by Chairman, ISRO. The visitors can view launch from this gallery in real time with naked eyes. Large screens are also placed to visually explain the various intricacies of launcher and satellites. In addition, pre and post launch activities will be telecasted and explained through these screens to the viewers.

Also, the possible effect such an event may                                                 have on the estimate of the reported UTC. The navigation message employs                                                 a ten (10) bit parameter that represents WN. Thus, the WN parameter                                                 “rolls over” to zero every 1024 weeks starting from the inception time                                                 i.e. 00:00 UT August 22, 1999. Consequently, the first WN rollover will                                                 now occur on April 6, 2019 BACKGROUND: The NavIC (IRNSS) System Time is based on a weighted average                                                 of multiple atomic clocks. The System Time used for user navigation                                                 solutions is a 27-bit binary number composed of two parameters Week                                                 Number (WN) and Time of Week Count (TOWC). The Week Number is an integer counter that gives the sequential week                                                 number from the origin of the IRNSS time. This parameter is coded on 10                                                 bits appearing in the first sub-frame of the navigation message, which                                                 covers 1024 weeks (about 19 years). The System Time start epoch is 00:00                                                 UT on Sunday August 22, 1999 (midnight between August 21 and 22). Thus,                                                 the first WN rollover as mentioned above is on April 6, 2019. Each WN                                                 rollover event defines a new Time Epoch. The System Time is currently in                                                 the First Epoch."

Rest of                                                     the 13% time in this cycle is allotted for collaborators and                                                     calibration. 2.1 AO cycle AstroSat is operated in a pre-planned manner i.e                                                     proposers are not present at Mission Operations Complex during the                                                     execution of their observations. Thus, all observations must be                                                     specified in full details in advance. 2.2 Targets of Opportunity (ToO)                                                         cycle 2.3 Legacy cycle Proposals are also                                                     invited for AstroSat Legacy observation programmes. These aremeant to be focussed programmes of long-term value with a                                                     substantial requirement for observation time. During the year                                                     October 2019-September 2020 at least 2 Mega seconds of AstroSat                                                     stare time (7%) will be devoted to Legacy programmes. Legacy                                                     programmes will be selected and executed by the AstroSat Science                                                     Working Group on behalf of thecommunity.

APPS is                                                     available online throughhttps://apps.issdc.gov.in/apps/auth/login.jsp.                                                     APPS is not downloadable and cannot be used off-line. An APPS                                                     proposer’s guide is available in ISSDC and ASC websites which                                                     elaborates on the proposal submission procedure.  A summary is                                                     provided in this section. 3.1 Proposal preparation                                                         pre-requisites Depending on the scientific requirement, proposals                                                     to AstroSat can be submitted for observation with a single or more                                                     instruments. Proposals are to be made as per APPS proposer’s guide                                                     and this procedures document. Proposers can refer to Redbook for the                                                     list of observed targets. AstroSat proposals will require the following                                                     information at the minimum. 3.2 APPS Instructions Instructions to fill various entries within APPS                                                     to prepare proposals are available online.

Queries on APPS can be mailed to                                                     (astrosathelp[at]iucaa[dot]in)                                                     for proposal preparation and submission. Queries will be answered on                                                     best effort basis. 3.3 Proposal Preparation Tools Proposers can use the following tools in order to                                                     prepare an AstroSat proposal. 3.3.1 ASTROVIEWER - Tool to aid Celestial                                                         Source Viewing The tool gives view periods of a selected                                                     celestial source for a prolonged period of one year maximum. Also,                                                     the view periods that satisfy all the constraints are provided                                                     orbit-wise so that the PIs of proposals can plan their observations                                                     more accurately and also season-wise. For UVIT payload users, view                                                     duration timings during eclipse that satisfies all envisaged                                                     constraints are available in a separate file as UVIT is expected to                                                     observe only in eclipse. The Tool has been designed to use the                                                     latest orbit information available on a daily basis and provides the                                                     various constraint angle characteristics in graphical plots so that                                                     GO can visualize the situation while planning for observations. The                                                     view period of the selected source is stored orbit wise and is made                                                     available in tabular form for the GO to use. Since the ram angle                                                     constraint for certain sources are on and off due to the closeness                                                     to the orbit inclination, this output contains flags ‘0’ for                                                     satisfying the constraint and ‘1’ for violating the constraint in                                                     the table. A Graphical User Interface program allows the user to                                                     interact remotely and obtain the required details. Additional                                                     information like Eclipse and occult Entry/Exit is also made                                                     available.

These may be used to carry out spectral simulations for X-ray                                                     sources, for example with the fakeit command in HEASOFT XSPEC. 3.3.3 UVIT Exposure Time Calculator                                                         (ETC) Help Page:http://uvit.iiap.res.in/Software/etc/HelpPresent Version: 2.0.0 (03 May, 2016). The UVIT Exposure Time                                                     Calculator (ETC) will help assess the feasibility of an observation.                                                     It calculates the expected count rate from a source in various UVIT                                                     filters, followed by either i) The Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR)                                                     achieved for a given observation time, or ii) The time required to                                                     reach a given SNR. Users may choose from a range of astronomical                                                     sources/spectra such as a star, black-body, galaxy, power law, etc.                                                     or choose to upload their own source spectrum. 3.3.4 Bright Source Warning Tool                                                         (BSWT) Help Page:http://uvit.iiap.res.in/Software/bswt/HelpPresent Version 2.0.0 (26 April 2017).  Aim of the tool is to                                                     inform the proposer whether the region of the sky around a science                                                     target is safe / un-safe for UVIT to take observations. The program                                                     scans for stars brighter than the safety threshold and lists out the                                                     count rates of these bright stars in all the 10 filters in the FUV                                                     and NUV telescopes. This program identifies all the bright stars                                                     within 20 arcmin radius of the target object.

Please note that as per the latest                                                     process used by UVIT this output is only used to check for filters                                                     of VIS (320-550 nm) channel; the checks for NUV/FUV filters are not                                                     made with this list. Hence the following mandatory checks are                                                     necessary. Mandatory checks to be done for UVIT                                                             observations The UVIT is not designed to observe very bright                                                     sources and the presence of a bright source in the UVIT field of                                                     observation can cause “Bright Object Trigger” in the hardware that                                                     would switch OFF all three detectors. In addition, the presence of                                                     an ultra-bright source near the UVIT field of view will scatter                                                     excessive radiation beyond the allowed limit. One of the UVITs, the                                                     VIS channel is primarily used for the spacecraft tracking. It is the                                                     proposers’ responsibility to ensure smooth tracking during their                                                     proposed observations. Hence the proposers need to exercise extra                                                     caution in preparing a proposal for UVIT observations. It is                                                     strongly recommended that the proposers follow the guideline                                                     described in detail in the document (please refer:http://astrosat-ssc.iucaa.in/uploads/APPS/AstroSat_proposers_guide_6March2018.pdf,                                                     v1.3, 03 March 2018) for mandatory checks to be done for UVIT                                                     observations. 3.4 Preparing an ASTROSAT                                                         proposal First time proposers will need to register into                                                     the APPS before they can prepare proposals. Proposers may go through                                                     the APPS help document regarding submission of proposals. 3.5 Proposal handling in APPS The receipt of each incoming proposal will be                                                     automatically acknowledged. At the end of submission date, the APPS                                                     will forward them to the ATAC for scientific review, while                                                     performing some assessments and preparing overall statistics on the                                                     response. All the committees are constituted by Chairman, ISRO. The ATAC will assign priorities to each proposal                                                     as A, B and C (and, as needed, grade individual observations within                                                     a proposal). The ATAC may ask some proposers to reduce the observing                                                     time or the number of targets in a proposal. Such proposals will be                                                     made available for revision to the PIs. The proposers will be able                                                     to submit a revised proposal before the set deadline only for                                                     changes recommended by the ATAC. Such proposals, if not revised                                                     before the deadline, will be excluded from the list of successful                                                     proposal. The technical feasibility of making the                                                     observations will be conducted by AstroSat Technical Committee (ATC)                                                     with support from Mission operations team. One of the parameters used to plan which                                                     observations will be carried out during a particular orbit, is the                                                     priority of the observations as allocated by the ATAC and ATC.                                                     However, for operational reasons, no guarantee can be given that a                                                     particular observation will in fact be executed, regardless of its                                                     grade. The general policy of the AstroSat is to avoid                                                     repeating the same observation, i.e. to avoid duplication. In general, a duplication is determined by                                                     consideration of the target coordinates and of the main observing                                                     parameters (especially the instrument(s) and the observing modes). A                                                     proposed observation duplicates another one, if the expected science                                                     data are essentially the same or of lower requirement (e.g. lower                                                     exposure time) and is therefore discouraged. It is, however allowed,                                                     to observe the same target with the same instrument configuration                                                     several times for variability studies. In addition, in large                                                     extended objects several pointings in the vicinity of a source may                                                     become necessary e.g., to image Coma Cluster of galaxies out to 2                                                     deg. diameter so as to cover its virial extent, and these may have                                                     co-ordinates that are not too different from that of the previous                                                     observation of a source. The responsibility for defining and resolving                                                     cases of duplication rests with the ATAC. The ATAC can allow                                                     observations of same targets in a proposed observation and an                                                     observation of a previous cycle. These should be restricted to                                                     proposals which provide convincing evidence that additional data are                                                     of scientific relevance. After the completion of observation, the raw data                                                     received will be converted to Level-1 data at Indian Space Science                                                     Data Center (ISSDC). ISSDC is responsible for governing the ingest,                                                     Quick look Display (QLD), processing (for level-0/1), archival (all                                                     levels, along with the auxiliary data) and dissemination of payload                                                     data. The data will be in standard FITS format. Level-1 data can be downloaded from the ISSDC                                                     website by the payload teams or Principal Investigators (PIs) of the                                                     proposals for science analysis as well as to produce higher level                                                     data products. Sample data, software and utilities are provided in                                                     the ASC website. The PI will be informed, after the completion of                                                     successful observation for downloading of processed Level-1 data.                                                     The standard pipeline software from Level-1 to Level-2 and any other                                                     higher level standard products will be made available to the PIs of                                                     proposals through ISSDC website. 5.1 Proprietary period There shall be a Proprietary period associated                                                     with observational data from all AstroSat instruments and in all                                                     phases and years after launch. This ""proprietary period"" would begin                                                     from the date the Level-1 data is made available to the payload                                                     teams and/or PIs of AO proposal. During this proprietary period, the data will NOT                                                     BE USED by any persons or teams other than those who submitted the                                                     proposal(s) for the observations, except in cases where the PIs of                                                     proposals themselves involve such other persons. The proprietary period for AO cycle data is 12                                                     months. After the proprietary period, all data will be kept in ISSDC                                                     public archive which is accessible both nationally and                                                     internationally. It is the responsibility of the Payload Operation                                                     Centres (POCs) to provide Level-2 products with a quality report to                                                     ISSDC.  Target of Opportunity (ToO) observations which are                                                     taken from ToO observation time will be processed immediately to                                                     Level 1 data and will be placed in ISSDC archive. These data are                                                     non-proprietary and are open to public immediately after                                                     observation. 5.2   Data rights &                                                         obligations The Principal Investigators (PIs) of all the                                                     proposals will have exclusive rights to all the data from the                                                     instruments he/ she has configured in the proposal amongst the                                                     co-aligned instruments (namely LAXPC, CZTI, SXT and twin telescope                                                     UVIT) for those fields that are observed with AstroSat against their                                                     proposals, Data rights for other objects detected within the                                                     observed field of observation also belong to the PI of the proposal,                                                     unless they communicate not to have it.

The concept of Space Technology Incubation Centre is to bring the Industry, academia and ISRO triad under one umbrella to contribute towards the R & D initiatives relevant to Indian Space Programme. The S-TIC concept is conceived with one selected major academic institute taking the lead role in a particular region and providing opportunities for final year graduate, post–graduate and research scholars. The research outcome of these students will be translated into a Proof of Concept or prototype through industries tied up with the S-TIC through ISRO. The qualification and validation of these products will be carried out in the labs of ISRO. Once qualified, there will be a buy back agreement of this product for future programmes of ISRO thereby eliminating the marketing effort. The first S-TIC was inaugurated at NIT Agartala on September 18, 2018 and it started functioning."

This cluster was first described by John Dreyer in 1888. This is the second globular cluster in the APOM series, the first one being NGC 1851, presented a year ago. A globular cluster is a very large group of stars formed from the same cloud of gas and dust at nearly the same time. They are called globular because of the spherical distribution of stars, and each cluster is held together as a single entity by the gravity of the star members. Globular clusters are few of the oldest known objects in our galaxy. The stars in NGC 288 are believed to be nearly 12.6 billion years old.                                              The Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (UVIT) on AstroSat has been used to image the stars in NGC 288 in the ultraviolet light, by a group of researchers from the Indian Institute of Astrophysics, Bangalore, and the National Research Council of Canada. The number of stars seen in the far-ultraviolet light are fewer than those seen in the near-ultraviolet light, and the reason for this is that only the hottest stars are seen in the far-ultraviolet.                                                                                          Since globular clusters have very old stars, many of the heavier ones have already evolved to later phases of stellar lives (eg. red giant stars, horizontal branch stars). About 115 hot horizontal branch stars having surface temperature nearly twice that of the surface of Sun have been detected in NGC 288 using the near and far-ultraviolet filters of UVIT. A couple of very hot stars (extreme horizontal branch stars) whose whose surface temperatures are nearly five times that of the Solar surface have also been found. Using a combination of ultraviolet and optical light, these researchers have also identified 68 blue stragglers in this cluster. A blue straggler is a star formed when two stars either merge or transfer mass between them. Such stars have been mostly found in globular clusters where the star density is high. The capabilities of UVIT have made it easy for the researchers to see and inspect hot stars towards the cluster individually, allowing them to study the properties of each star, such as the mass and temperature.                                                                                          The paper describing their results can be downloaded here.

"event/Celebrations_of_1000th_Casting_Completion_by_SPROB","has_description","Celebrations of 1000th Casting Completion by SPROBHome/Archives/Celebrations of 1000th Casting A function was organised at Satish Dhawan Space Centre (SDSC) SHAR, Sriharikota to celebrate the completion of 1000th solid motor casting by Solid Propellant Space Booster Plant (SPROB).  The function was presided over by Chairman, ISRO and attended by former SHAR Directors, the former ISRO stalwarts, who has immensely contributed in establishment of SPROB.Solid propulsion plays an important role in launch vehicle technology. The reliability, simplicity, easy scalability and high thrust capability of a solid propulsion system makes it a preferable solution for a launch vehicle.For developing the essential expertise in large Solid Rocket Motors, SPROB was established at Sriharikota and commissioned in 1977 with the realisation of a 1 m diameter monolithic motor for SLV-3.In the 1980s, the requirement of the operational Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) called for a major expansion of the scope and capacity of the facilities at SPROB. This necessitated quantum shift in propellant formulation technology using the indigenously developed HTPB binder and vertical propellant mixers. Self-reliance in solid propellant production was achieved by indigenous development and realisation of several specialised equipment.For manufacturing the massive S200 solid rocket motors of GSLV MkIII vehicle, a new plant was built at SPROB. Decades of experience gained in processing and operation of SPROB was utilised in the design and realisation of this world class plant.  Successful commissioning of this vast with state of the art plant in 2008 has enabled the Indian space programme to evolve complex missions like Chandrayaan 2 and Gaganyaan.SPROB is now carrying out a challenging task to deliver 12 S139 (PSLV first stage) motors by 2019 end, which is double the present capacity.   With meticulous planning and spirited efforts, 29 additional facilities are being set up with innovative technical aspects and fail-safe process automation. With the commissioning of these facilities, the overall annual production capacity of the plant will make a giant leap within a record time."

Located nearly 3,800 light years away in the constellation Scorpius,NGC 6302is a planetary nebula, whose shape is strikingly similar to the wings of a butterfly, hence aptly named as the Butterfly Nebula. This is the second planetary nebula that we bring forth to you, the first being NGC 40, covered in the APOM issue of December 2017.planetary nebulaare beautiful structures formed during the last few stages of the lives of stars like the Sun or a few times heavier. As the stars burn up all the hydrogen or helium fuel, they increase in size and become redder in colour, and are known asgiant stars. As the giant star passes throughfew more stages, it continually sheds its outer layers revealing an inner hot core called thewhite dwarf. The white dwarf heats up the spewed-out gas which shines in the form of planetary nebula. Many of these planetary nebulae have strikingly symmetric shapes that need not be spherical and it has been suggested that this could be due to the various physical processes occurring in and around the star when it hurls out the gas from the outer layers. These nebulae are named planetary because when astronomers first observed them, they thought that these resembled planets. We now know that this is not the case, although the name has lingered.Prof Kameshwar Rao, from the Indian Institute of Astrophysics (IIA), and his team have been investigating planetary nebulae in the ultraviolet light. They have imaged the Butterfly Nebula through the far and near-ultraviolet filters of the Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (UVIT) of AstroSat. Using these images, they have discovered that gas which is bright in the far-ultraviolet extends beyond the known wings of the butterfly out to 5.5 light years from the centre, nearly three times of what is seen in the optical. The reddish coloured figure on the right is the far ultra-violet image of the Butterfly Nebula. The blue image is a cartoon that represents the full extent of the far-ultraviolet emission. These researchers argue that the extended far-ultraviolet light is due to cold hydrogen molecules in the gas present in the outer parts of the nebula which are excited by the central star. They suspect that these far-ultraviolet structures of the planetary nebula point to the possible presence of two central stars in abinary systemthat are gravitationally bound. The results have been published in the journal Astronomy & Astrophysics and the paper can beread here."

To carry out this test, an LAPT module which is a scaled down version of Vikram with all the required hardware was realised for testing in Earth environment. The reason for the scaling down is to compensate the effect of Earth’s gravity as compared to Moon’s gravity and to match the thrust generation of sea level Liquid Engines as compared to flight engines which will operate in vacuum environment. The module was tethered to a crane hook for conducting the test. To carry out this test, a special test facility was erected at ISRO Propulsion Complex, Mahendragiri.The objective of the test was to assess the closed loop integrated performance of Sensors, Actuators and Navigation, Guidance & Control (NGC) and guidance algorithms below 100 m height. Three tests have been conceived as part of LAPT Phase-2 activities to demonstrate these objectives. First test was conducted to demonstrate Vertical Descent while second Test  was conducted to demonstrate Hovering.The third and final test was successfully conducted to demonstrate re-targeting in a Parabolic Trajectory, on 25th Oct 2018 at ISRO Propulsion Complex, Mahendragiri. This test demonstrated the capability of the NGC system of Vikram to meet the mission requirement of safe, soft and precise landing on the lunar surface by steering the module horizontally as well as vertically down to a pre-defined target. With this, all the tests have been completed successfully. This is a major milestone accomplished in Chandrayaan-2 Lander."

It was launched into space by ISRO exactly 3 years ago, on 28 September 2015, on board the PSLV-C30.  This unique observatory has five instruments on board, all of which can look at the same piece of sky simultaneously. These five telescopes give AstroSat the capability of observing in the ultraviolet, X-ray and gamma ray bands. Thus, the range of wavelengths that AstroSat can observe spans a factor of about 16000, from the lowest (200 nm in the Near UV) to the highest (0.012 nm or 100 keV in the gamma rays). These five instruments are the Ultra Violet Imaging Telescope (UVIT), the Soft X-ray Telescope (SXT), the Large Area X-ray Proportional Counter (LAXPC), the Cadmium-Zinc-Telluride Imager (CZTI) and the Scanning Sky Monitor (SSM).                                                  Over the last one year, we have brought you 12 images from AstroSat. These APOMs, or AstroSat Pictures of the Month, have mostly been from the UVIT, since it is best suited at producing images. The strength of the X-ray and gamma ray telescopes lies in their incredibly precise timing and their spectral capabilities, and we will be bringing you spectra and light curves of interesting objects from time to time too.                                                                                                  This month's APOM is of AstroSat itself! The top two panels are pictures of the fully assembled AstroSat from two different angles. All five telescopes, along with many sensors can be seen. The golden colour is due to the layer wrapping the satellite that thermally insulates it in space. Compare these two photographs with the artists conception of Astrosat in the pabel below. Here, each of the five telescopes are labelled, along with the solar panels which were unfurled in space after launch. Can you identify each of the five telescopes in the two photographs in the top panel?"

S-TIC will provide projects of importance to the ongoing and futuristic programmes of ISRO for the Research, Post Graduate and Under Graduate students. This is expected to inculcate much required research culture among the student community. The final year students will be exposed to the problems of relevance and importance to ISRO and proof of concept or prototype developed by them will be validated through nearby tie-up industries. The products once realised will be validated and qualified in the existing facilities of ISRO. Once qualified, they can be inducted in the on-going projects of ISRO and buy back arrangement can be made. Through this, it is hoped to enthuse students to think differently to initiate start-up enterprises which can generate employment. The first S-TIC is being initiated in the North-Eastern region to encourage space related research activities in that region.                                                  Five more such Space Technology Incubation Centres are being planned region wise in other parts of the county.

We feature the image of the Tycho Supernova remnant or SN                                                 1572, imaged by the Soft X-ray Telescope (SXT). Located in the                                                 constellation Cassiopeia, at a distance of about 10000 light years, SN                                                 1572 is a historic object. It is one of the 8 supernova explosions that                                                 were seen with the naked eye. This new star appeared in the sky during                                                 early November in 1572, and was observed by many astronomers across                                                 Europe and China. It is named after Tycho Brahe since he was the one who                                                 studied it in great detail till it faded away in 1574. He published his                                                 observations in his work 'Concerning the Star, new and never before seen                                                 in the life or memory of anyone', which included a star chart too. At                                                 its peak, it rivalled Venus at its brightest, confounded astronomers at                                                 that time, and changed their perspective of an unchanging sky. X-ray image of the Tycho Supernova Remnant in the 0.8-2.0                                                         nanometres (0.6-1.6 keV) range, made by the Soft X-ray Telescope                                                         on board AstroSat. The supernova remnant is roughly 8 arcminutes big (3.7 times smaller                                                 than the full moon in the sky) and the emission is brighter near the                                                 edge of the expanding supernova remnant.                                                  Pic Credit: Kulinder Pal Singh (IISER Mohali) and the entire SXT                                                 Instrument and POC teams at TIFR, University of Leicester, and IUCAA                                                  We now know, from historic data, that this was a Type 1a supernova.                                                 Sometimes, a normal star and a white dwarf (which is a very compact                                                 object that is the end stage of stars like our Sun) orbit each other.                                                 Material from the normal star is pulled on to the white dwarf due to                                                 gravity, making it heavier. When the mass of the white dwarf exceeds the                                                 famous Chandrasekhar Limit, it explodes, leading to a Type 1a supernova,                                                 like our SN 1572. What we see today is what is left of this explosion.                                                 The debris is expanding outwards like a sphere, with an edge which is                                                 the shock front. This supernova remnant, discovered first in radio                                                 wavelengths, and then in optical and X-rays and infrared, is a beautiful                                                 object indeed.                                                  X-rays can penetrate metal easily. Hence, the cleverly designed Soft                                                 X-ray Telescope uses 320 concentric gold coated mirrors and a very cold                                                 CCD to form images in the X-ray. The image of the Tycho Supernova                                                 remnant shown here is made from photons with wavelengths between 0.8 to                                                 2.0 nanometres (0.6-1.6 keV). Most of this emission, coming from the                                                 limb of the expanding shell, is due to emission from Iron atoms where                                                 electrons jump from higher levels to the 2nd level.

"event/AstroSat_Picture_of_the_Month_(June_2018)","has_description","AstroSat Picture of the Month (June 2018)Home/Archives/AstroSat Picture of the Month (June 2018) Entire clusters of galaxies merging together – an ultraviolet view Previously, we had brought you AstroSat images of individual galaxies, two galaxies merging with each other, and even a lone galaxy falling into a cluster of other galaxies. This month, we give you Abell 2256, an extremely well studied and special galaxy cluster. Abell 2256 is actually made of three separate clusters of galaxies that are all merging with each other, and will form a single massive cluster in the future. This object is at a distance of more than 800 million light years from us, and is the most distant APOM so far. The three merging clusters in Abell 2256 contains more than 500 galaxies, and the cluster is almost 100 times larger and more than 1500 times as massive as our own galaxy! This merger has produced a rich diversity of structures that have been imaged in radio wavelengths by every radio telescope in the world.                                                  This cluster contains galaxies spread over a large area, and we have zoomed in on six of these galaxies to show you their ultraviolet images. The brightest objects in the full image are actually foreground stars in our galaxy which happen to lie in the same direction as Abell 2256. Credits: UVIT team/ISRO/CSA. We know that galaxy clusters are places where many spiral galaxies transform slowly into lenticular and elliptical galaxies. Spiral galaxies, like our own Milky Way, are bluer in colour and are forming stars constantly. Elliptical and lenticular galaxies however, are redder and have mainly old stars in them. Abell 2256 is one such galaxy cluster where we believe many galaxies are going through this metamorphosis. Astronomers stared at Abell 2256 for 5 hours using the UVIT on board AstroSat to image these star forming spiral galaxies, using the ultraviolet light emitted by their hot young stars. The fine detail with which the entire galaxy cluster could be imaged out to its edges by UVIT is keeping astronomers busy over the last few months. They are investigating the nature of individual galaxies in Abell 2256. They also hope to understand how these galaxies will transform into lenticular and elliptical galaxies in the future."

Instead of ultraviolet images from UVIT, we bring you an exciting plot from the X-ray telescope, Cadmium-Zinc-Telluride Imager (CZTI), onboard the AstroSat. This new result, covered by the press last year, announced the discovery of X-ray polarisation from the Crab Nebula that seemed to vary in an unexpected way over the period of the pulsar within. This discovery also heralded the beginning of the field of X-ray polarisation in astronomy. Let us look at what this means.                                          The Crab Nebula which is about 6500 light years away in the constellation Taurus, is a result of a supernova explosion of a massive star, that was seen in 1054 AD. Powering this supernova remnant is a very strange object, known as the Crab Pulsar. The end products of massive stars are neutron stars, which weigh as much as the Sun but are only as big as a city. These rapidly spinning objects are made of exotic matter and have very strong magnetic fields. Under the right circumstances, we see them as a pulsar, which resembles a celestial lighthouse whose beam sweeps past the Earth once every pulsar rotation. Our Crab Pulsar rotates as fast as 30 times a second, and its lighthouse-like pulses have been studied extensively all the way from radio to X-rays. Credit: Cadmium-Zinc-Telluride Imager (CZTI) team"

Here we present an ultraviolet image of one such 'Jellyfish Galaxy', JO201. We know that galaxies usually cluster together because of their mutual gravity. These Galaxy Clusters can have 100s to 1000s of galaxies in them! In these clusters, the space between these galaxies is filled with very hot gas. When an external galaxy is attracted by the gravitational force of a cluster, it moves through this hot gas. When it does so, it feels this gas as a wind that is blowing against it, much like a bicyclist or a runner feels the air blowing back past them.  If the galaxy is falling fast enough through this gas, then this wind can even dislodge the gas from this galaxy's gravitational pull. This stripped-off gas forms tails behind the infalling galaxy, and new stars can form out of this gas. Hence, these galaxies resemble a jellyfish with tentacles. We know a number of such jellyfish galaxies in the sky, and this image shows JO201, one such galaxy falling into the galaxy cluster Abell 85. The ultraviolet image taken by AstroSat shows the hot young stars formed from the gas that have been pushed out of this galaxy. The galaxy JO201 itself is moving in a direction towards us with an inclination towards the right.  Koshy and his collaborators have used the superior resolution of UVIT to study how stars are being formed in individual parts of the tentacles of the jellyfish galaxy JO201.

"event/AstroSat_Picture_of_the_Month_(March_2018)","has_description","AstroSat Picture of the Month (March 2018)Home/Archives/AstroSat Picture of the Month (March 2018) A billion years ago, two massive galaxies collided together, ripping apart tails of gas and dust from each other. The two galaxies then merged to form a single galaxy, NGC 7252. Located 220 million light years away in the southern constellation of Aquarius, the optical images show stars and gas twirling around in intricate filaments around a bright central core. These loops resemble a picture of electrons going around the nucleus, and hence NGC 7252 was named 'Atoms for peace' galaxy, in honour of the influential speech by the US President Eisenhower in 1961, where he advocated the use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes.  The effects of the violent collision are evident from the furious star forming activity going on in the two tails of the galaxies. These tails of gas and stars were pulled out from the galaxies in their dance around each other before their merger. Since ultraviolet light traces young hot stars, Koshy George and his collaborators used the Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (UVIT) of AstroSat to trace the locations of ongoing star formation along the tidal tails. Using their data, they were able to measure the rate at which new stars are being formed, and study how this rate changes as we move along this tail.  These studies have been published in this paper.https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.09493"

K. Sutaria, K.P. Singh, P. T. Rahna,  J. Murthy, A.K. Ray and N.K. Rao The Witch's Broom or the Western Veil, is a part of a large Supernova Remnant called the Cygnus Loop or the Veil Nebula. Extending over 3 degrees in the sky (compared to the full moon which is 0.5 degrees), and located in the northern constellation of Cygnus, the entire Cygnus Loop is 75 light years in diameter, and around 1470 light years away. Though the nebula is one of the most beautiful and colorful objects in the sky, it is quite faint due to its large angular size and a big telescope in a dark sky is needed to fully appreciate it in all its glory.Different parts of this object were discovered separately and given different names. The Witch's Broom, or NGC 6960 is a part of this gigantic Supernova Remnant. This remnant is the result of a very massive star exploding sometime between 3000 and 6000 B.C. The shock waves of this explosion, as they blast through the surrounding gas, produce emission in all bands of light, including radio, visible, ultra-violet and X-rays. Since the expanding shells are extremely thin and is almost transparent to background optical light, only the edges are bright enough to see. This is why we see fine filaments or ropes that resemble a broom.The Near Ultra-Violet and Far Ultra-Violet images of the Witch's Broom captured by AstroSat's UVIT show emission from these delicate glowing filaments, primarily from ionized Silicon, Carbon, Iron and Helium. Astronomers are using this data to study the chemicals in this gas, and how they are heated by the shock of the explosion."

The X-rays are produced when matter is accreted from the                                                 donor star (usually a relatively normal star) onto the accretor, which                                                 is very compact – a Neutron Star or Black Hole.                                                  4U 1728-34 is a Neutron Star low mass X-ray binary (NS-LMXB) which is                                                 known to exhibit regular thermo-nuclear bursts (Type-I) of accreted                                                 matter onto the Neutron Star surface. The burst oscillations (BO)                                                 observed during the initial phase of the Type-1 burst is one of the                                                 important diagnostic tool to measure the spin period of the NS-LMXB.                                                  In addition to BO, which originates at the surface of NS, quasi-periodic                                                 oscillations (QPO) of X-ray radiation from the accreting gas is also a                                                 common phenomenon observed in X-ray binaries. QPOs in milliseconds                                                 timescale are very important tool to understand the dynamics of                                                 accretion flow at the close vicinity of the compact objects.                                                  The source 4U 1728-34 was observed by LAXPC onboard AstroSat on 8th                                                 March 2016 for ~ 3 ksec duration. Dynamical power density spectrum in                                                 the 3-20 keV band during the observation, reveals the presence of a high                                                 frequency QPO (HFQPO) whose frequency drifted from ~ 815 Hz at the                                                 beginning of the observation to about 850 Hz (fig.1). The QPO is also                                                 detected, for the first time in the 10-20 keV band by LAXPC (fig.2). In the early phase of the burst, a coherent burst oscillation was                                                 observed at around 363 Hz. The frequency varies from ~361.5 to ~363.5 Hz                                                 which has been reported by Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE) during                                                 earlier burst observations.                                                  Thus LAXPC demonstrated the capability of detecting millisecond timing                                                 phenomenon even from short observations.

The red gas cloud is the Bow-Tie nebula, which is being illuminated by the central hot star.The gold coloured diffuse light surrounding the nebula is the newly discovered far ultra-violet halo. Image credit: Kameswara Rao et.al. NGC 40, or the Bow-Tie Nebula, is a Planetary Nebula about 3500 light years away from us, in the northern constellation of Cepheus. Discovered by William Herschel in 1788, it can be seen in a moderate sized telescope                                          by amateur astronomers. Earlier optical images of NGC 40 show a central star as hot as about 70000 K surrounded by expanding gas that gives it its characteristic shape. The central hot star is blowing a fast hot wind                                          into this surrounding gas at 1700 km/s, and heating it up. Kameswara Rao and his colleagues used the AstroSat to image this object in many regions of the ultra-violet. First, however, let us look at what a planetary nebula is. Some old Red Giant stars  throw out their outer                                          layers of gas, which expands away from the star. This exposes the hot inner part of the star, whose radiation makes the outer gas layers shine brightly as a planetary nebula. Our Sun too, will meet this same fate.                                          With time, the inner star will evolve to become a White Dwarf, a very strange object indeed. And the heavier elements cooked inside the stars, thrown out into space, go back into forming newer stars and planets                                          like ours. The astronomers who looked at the ultra-violet images of NGC 40 using AstroSat, were not only able to study the central hot star and the surrounding gas, but also made a new discovery. As the image shows, they discovered,                                          for the first time, a large halo of ultra-violet radiation in the far UV band surrounding the entire nebula. This halo,they figure out, is due to molecules energized due to the light from the central star. The paper describing these results can be downloaded fromhttps://arxiv.org/abs/1711.07698"

"event/AstroSat_Picture_of_the_Month_(November_2017)","has_description","AstroSat Picture of the Month (November 2017)Home/Archives/AstroSat Picture of the Month (November 2017) NGC 1851 is a Globular Cluster which is almost 40000 light years away from us, in the southern constellation of Columba, near Canis Major. A Globular Cluster is a group of hundreds of thousands of stars tightly bound together by their own gravity.                                              All the stars in these spherical clusters orbit around the centre of our galaxy together. NGC 1851, or Caldwell 73, is one such cluster, visible in a moderate telescope at a magnitude of 7.3, with a size that is a third of the full moon. It was                                              discovered by James Dunlop from Australia in 1826. The stars in a Globular Cluster are usually born together, and hence share similar properties. However, NGC 1851 is one of the few clusters where two distinct types of stars with different properties seem to co-exist! Many individual stars in this object                                          have been studied before with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), but good ultraviolet images were needed to understand this mystery better. This prompted a group of 18 astronomers, including 12 from India, to use the UVIT on board the AstroSat. They imaged                                          this cluster in the Near and Far ultraviolet wavebands far better than earlier attempts with other telescopes. The superior resolution of AstroSat allowed them, for the first time, to measure the ultraviolet properties of individual stars in the inner crowded region of the cluster. Using this data, they could show that NGC 1851 does indeed have two distinct families                                          of stars within it, which still retain their separate histories. This tells us that NGC 1851 was probably formed when two smaller clusters merged together some time in the past!

The bright spots along the spiral arms are regions of active star formation. Credits: UVIT Team. NGC 2336 is a magnificent barred spiral galaxy located in the northern constellation of Camelopardalis, or the giraffe. At a distance of 105 million light years away from us, it can even be seen through medium-sized amateur telescopes under dark skies.                                              This galaxy was discovered by the German astronomer Ernst Tempel in 1877. NGC 2336 has a highly developed and splendid spiral arm structure that emanates from a ring of stars surrounding a central bar. The spiral arms contain a number of star forming                                              regions, or nebulae. These nebulae shine because of hot young stars that are bright in the ultraviolet. This was one of the first objects chosen to be imaged by the Ultra-Violet Imaging Telescope (UVIT) on board AstroSat, in order to test its ability to resolve complex structure. The Near-UV (200-300 nm) and Far-UV (130-180 nm) images obtained were spectacular,                                          showing details finer than in the image from the GALEX ultraviolet telescope. Astronomers found that the resolution of UVIT was 1.2 arc-seconds in the Near-UV and 1.5 arc-seconds in the Far-UV, which was much better than the initial goal of 1.8 arc-seconds.                                          This superior resolving power, along with its large field of view, make UVIT an excellent instrument for investigating star formation in large galaxies like NGC 2336.

"event/AstroSat_contributes_to_the_saga_of_Gravitational_Wave_Astronomy","has_description","AstroSat contributes to the saga of Gravitational Wave AstronomyHome/Archives/AstroSat contributes to the saga On August 17, 2017, scientists seeking the holy grail of gravitational wave (GW) astronomy struck gold.  The elusive and long sought after GW signals from merging binary neutron stars were found and multi-messenger observations provided tell-tale signs of this merger                                              to clinch the issue without any qualms. Two of the GW detectors in the US picked up the signal and a third, working in Europe, confirmed it. Several of the satellites in the sky detected signals from this event across various bands of the electromagnetic spectrum, and                                              a vast array of optical and radio telescopes worldwidetrained their vision into this new phenomenon, finding a variety of corroborating signals. The AstroSat scientists, who pitched in with their efforts, today stand shoulder to shoulder with a few thousand scientists across the globe (including three Nobel Prize winners and a few scores of other Indian scientists) to announce this  momentous discovery and an                                              `open sesame’ moment of staring at the huge cache of scientific discovery that this new era of`multi-messenger, time-domain astronomy’ opens up. Gravitational Wave Astronomy: the last frontier Any accelerated electronic charge emits electromgnetic radiation: scientists routinely use this to generate and send electromagnetic waves like radio waves, optical light, and X-rays. Any moving mass disturbs the space time and a `quadropole’ moment in the moving mass                                                should generate gravitational waves: theorised Albert Einstein a hundred years ago. Einstein’s words are treated as Veda Vakya or Gospel Truth, and astronomers routinely use this to understand the dynamics of compact large masses in the cosmos. Russell A. Hulse and Joseph                                                H. Taylor, Jr discovered two radio pulsars going around each other, slowly hurtling towards each other, and they invoked Einstein’s gravitational wave theory to understand their behavour: they were duly awarded a Nobel Prize for this work. This opens up an interesting                                                question-shouldn’t astronomers, who use every branch of electromagnetic radiation from radio to gamma-rays to prise open the secrets of the Universe, use gravitational waves to understand exotic features of the cosmos- like the ripples of the Big Bang or merging of black                                                holes when galaxies collide ? Well, they should,but the catch lies in the fact that the gravitational force is extremely  weaker than the electromagnetic force, and common sense deems that even the most sensitive detectors that humans can build cannot detect the most exotic gravitaional wave sources that                                              we can imagine. However, during  the past few decades, a huge number of dedicated scientists have built the most sophisticated detectors capable of measuring infinitesimal movement of mass corresponding to a tiny fraction of a nanometer in kilmoter sized objects so that they                                              would be sensitive to the gravitational waves from outer space. Year after year, they kept looking for signs of merging neutron stars, but the quest was in vain ! Mother Nature usually likes to keep surprises up her sleeve! When the GW detectors with highly improved sensitivity were switched ON in 2015, they found something: not a neutron star-neutron star merger, but a totally unexpected event of two massive black holes merging and spewing                                              out energy equivalent to the complete burning out of mass corresponding to two Suns. This is indeed a momentous discovery, and the architects of this humongous human effort, Kip Thorne, Rainer Weiss, and Barry Barish, duly got this year’s Nobel Prize. What about the elusive case of the merger of two neutron stars anticipated from the discovery of Messers Hulse and Taylor?During the past two years, four GW events were discovered, however, they were all due to mergers of black holes. The problem with merging black holes is that they                                              are, as apparent from the name, `black’;i.e., apart from the GW events,there are no tell tale signs of the merger in any other branch of electromagnetic radiation. So, we cannot determinewhere they are coming from, or what are their progenitors. This is not the case for neutron star                                              mergers. It was firmly believed that when GW events are discovered from neutron star mergers, they would be accompanied by huge amounts of electromagnetic radiation, which will help us pin down the sources of these events. The whole scientific community was eagerly waiting for this much anticipated event. CZT Imager of AstroSat pitches in AstroSat was launched on September 28, 2015 and the CZT Imager (CZTI)  instrument of AstroSat was the first instrument to be made operational. On October 6, 2015, the first day of operation, CZTI detected a gamma-ray burst (GRB) and proved to be an efficient GRB detector. The scientists                                              working with the CZTI data realised that it would be a wonderful instrument to detectany gamma-ray events accompanying the GW sources. The problem with detecting such gamma-ray events is that they are rare, unpredictable, and can come from any direction in the sky. Hence, the detectors need to have all sky sensitivity, and generally, there is a trade off in their observing capabilities.  Currently, there are three sensitive                                              operating GRB monitors, along with a few more less sensitive detectors, each having their own capabilities and limitations. The most sensitive GRB monitor currently operating is the Swift satellite, however, it can observe only one tenth of the sky at any given time. CZTI and the Fermi satellite,                                              on the other hand, are sensitive to much larger regions in the sky, but have very limited capability to localise these events. The anti-coincidence shield of the INTEGRAL satellite, too, can act as a GRB monitor. Each of these instruments played their part in the race to detect gamma-ray signals accompanying the GW events. During the very first GW event on September 14, 2015 (before the launch of AstroSat), Fermi claimed that it haddetected a GRB like event within 0.4 s of the GW event. Observations from                                              the INTEGRAL satellite, however, disagreed: the consensus was that this could be some unrelated spike in the background. During another GW event detected in January 2017, optical astronomers saw, the very next day of the event, some source gradually diminishing in brightness. Could this be the                                          tell-tale signs of something happening in the GW source? CZTI chipped in with a firm No! It had detected a GRB, 21 hours after the GW event. The fading optical source was shown to be this GRB, unrelated to the GW event. Aug 17, 2017: a red letter day On August 17, 2017, the much anticipated event occurred. The GW detectors in US registered a very long series of signals, or `chirps’, closely resembling what the scientists have simulated for decades to be coming from neutron star coalescence. Even before they could announce this discovery, the Fermi satellite had detected a GRB at the same time: in fact                                              within a couple of seconds of the GW event. Could this also be an unrelated background fluctuation event? Very unlikely, because, at exactly the same time, the anti-coincidence shield in the INTEGRAL satellite had also detected this GRB. What about Swift and CZTI? They didn’t detect any! The event should                                              probably be outside the narrow field of view of Swift. What about CZTI? It was active and operating and the GRB should have been detected. The only way to reconcile was to assume that the source was blocked by the Earth: this helped to narrow down the possible source regions of the GW event. Soon, the GW detectors from Europe too pitched in, and the region of the sky responsible for the GW event and GRB was narrowed down to a small region. Optical telescopes around the world scanned each and every galaxy in this region and, lo and behold, there indeed was a bright optical object, not seen before,                                              near a galaxy called NGC 4993. The rest, as they say, is history. Soon, infra-red and ultraviolet emissions were seen from this source. Nine days later, an X-ray source was detected, and fifteen days later, radio emission was also observed. From such vast multi-wavelength data, the physics of colliding and merging neutron stars were studied                                              in depth. An exciting find is that the material ejected in the event is rich in heavy elements, so much so that, colliding neutron stars can account for the entire supply of precious metals, like gold, platinum and silver, in the universe.  Production of these elements have been difficult to understand, and now                                              the source has been found! The story of GW170817 bears testimony to the amazing outcome possible when all the world’s best instruments are combined for a single purpose. The collaborative efforts of a number of teams worldwide lends an added credibility to this exciting and substantial discovery and ushers in a new era in multi-messenger,                                              time-domain astronomy! Scientific curiosity: never satiated The GW detectors are taking a year off to return with an improved sensitivity. Neutron star merger events and the accompanying `kilonova’ should be fairly common observations during the next run.  There should be more of black hole merger events as well. Scientists are already dreaming about the rich future harvests: Can we get any tell-tale signatures of black hole mergers to identify where they are coming from? Perhaps more sensitive all sky detectors would help with an answer. Can these events be used as a tool for distance measurement to refine cosmology? A massive collaboration between GW theorists and kilonova observers should be able to do it. Can we learn anything about the regions close to black hole? Possible. Are there some strange stars among the neutron stars? Certainly more such objects will tell us. Finally, has Mother Nature more surprises up her sleeve? Only the future will tell us! What next? Significant next steps will involve making detectors more sensitive, improving localisation capability and most importantly, continued collaboration of observatories worldwide spanning all electromagnetic bands, neutrinos and gravitational waves. In the Indian space science context, the capability of CZTI would certainly be improved through better algorithms and simulations: it should be possible to independently confirm and localise gamma-ray events for future GW associations. Perhaps, even a much improved CZTI like all sky monitor could be designed and flown! Multi-messenger studies of GW170817 incorporating the contribution of AstroSat CZTI are published in the journalsScienceandAstrophysical Journal Letters. Papers"

While he was a tough task master with deep insight,                                             abundant enthusiasm and indefatigable tenacity, and penchant for speedy                                             action, his ability to instantly connect                                             with his subordinates is an attribute often cited as his best quality with                                             each one of them has one story or other to tell about his personal                                             interactions and experience with him. Above all, Prof. U.R.Rao was a great Institution builder of global repute, and ranks                                     along with Dr Vikram Sarabhai and Prof. Satish Dhawan as the one who brought the                                     vision and mission                                     focus in the Indian space programme with unstinted commitment to align the goals of                                     the organisation with national development. In this, he had to take in his stride                                     the brunt of the                                     innumerable initial difficulties, obstacles and failures of the satellites and                                     launch vehicles in the experimental and its transition to operational era. He                                     steadfastly brought in high                                     levels of professional competence, mutual respect, and team spirit with trust that                                     became the organisational norm and continues to be the guiding force in defining                                     what is known today as                                     ‘ISRO culture’. Just a few reflections of his stellar role are brought in the following paragraphs. ISRO will always remember Prof. U.R.Rao’s abundant energy, dynamism and his sense of                                     urgency and enthusiasm to get the things done on time with professional finesse. His                                     determination and speed                                     in making decisions to achieve the seemingly impossible task of building ARYABHATA,                                     the first satellite, starting from the scratch, within the stipulated time and                                     budget, without any basic                                     infrastructure in place, and with an inexperienced young team was something                                     phenomenal. ARYABHATA brought into fore his project management and system                                     engineering abilities as well as the faith                                     he had nurtured in his team of scientists and engineers. He proved conclusively that                                     India has the ability to master the high technology and deliver world-class                                     products, if there is a professional                                     leadership that leads from the front, bestowing confidence and encouragement, and                                     posing adequate scientific and technological challenges to the younger generation.                                     In fact, it has become the watch                                     words for all subsequent more complex satellite and launch vehicle missions of ISRO. Immediately after ARYABHATA, Prof. Rao went on to conceive the experimental remote                                     sensing satellites, BHASKARA 1&2, ROHINI D2 and technology satellites in the SROSS                                     series, which together provided                                     the foundation for the operational Indian Remote Sensing Satellites (IRS) for                                     natural resources & environmental applications; and the experimental communication                                     satellite, APPLE, as first step to boldly                                     embark on ISRO’s ambitious operational Indian National Satellites (INSAT) for                                     communication applications. IRS became a well known global brand, even capturing                                     global leadership and attention as India’s                                     imaging capability made a quantum jump from around 1 Km spatial resolution in                                     BHASKARA 1&2 to better than 1 metre, in the Technology Experimental Satellite (TES)                                     launched in 1999. INSAT series of satellites                                     made India a leading country in the world in providing domestic satellite                                     communication services. For this immense contribution in building self reliance in                                     satellite technology, Prof. Rao is affectionately                                     called asFATHER OF INDIAN SATELLITE PROGRAMME. For launch vehicle technology, bestowed with more restrictions and embargos from the                                     developed world, it was always major challenge. Prof. Rao met the brunt of these                                     sanctions during his tenure as Chairman, ISRO.                                     He faced them with immense grit and determination in accelerating the efforts                                     towards operationalising the Indian launch vehicle programme in the ASLV, PSLV as                                     well as the GSLV Cryo-engines at various stages in                                     spite of these obstacles and restrictions. Undaunted by the failure of the first two                                     developmental flights of ASLV missions, Prof. Rao provided stellar leadership to the                                     operational PSLV programme and his bold                                     initiatives in the development of indigenous cryogenic technology was legendary.                                     Though the programme got inordinately delayed due to international sanctions, the                                     cryogenic engines got ultimately developed within                                     the country. With the recent successful launching of GSLV Mark III with indigenous                                     cryogenic engines, Prof. Rao was justifiably happy that all his earlier efforts                                     towards making a self-reliant operational launch                                     vehicle programme, have at last borne fruits. Even today, the launch vehicle                                     community remembers Prof. Rao for his unstinted support and courage during those                                     critical years. Any Tribute to Prof. U.R. Rao will not be complete if it does not contain his                                     remarkable contribution to space technology applications using satellite remote                                     sensing and satellite communications. The breadth and depth                                     of knowledge and the passion he had for making use of space-based inputs in                                     developmental planning were exemplified when he initiated many bold experiments                                     making India as the leader in carrying out space based applications                                     of direct relevance to the country. Forest cover mapping; Wastelands mapping: Rajiv                                     Gandhi National Drinking Water Mission;; Flood mapping: National Agricultural                                     Drought Assessment and Monitoring System (NADAMS); and Integrated                                     Mission for Sustainable Development (IMSD) some of the major initiatives taken up by                                     him with gusto. IMSD was the most significant among them, where Prof. Rao boldly                                     advocated remote sensing as a key element in preparing resource                                     maps and evolving action plans at watershed level, to provide grass-root solutions,                                     epitomising the confluence of scientific knowledge, administrative acumen, and local                                     wisdom towards conserving the land and water resources. His                                     advocacy on IMSD went to the extent of roping in some young enthusiastic district                                     collectors and NGOs from across the country to implement the action plan on the                                     ground. Some of the success stories of IMSD were reported increase in                                     ground water level, increased cropping intensity along with increased return on                                     investment for the poor farmers in the rainfed agricultural areas. No wonder IMSD                                     became the inspirational role model for all the later projects, including                                     its adaptation in the much acclaimed World Bank aided Sujala Watershed Development                                     Programme in Karnataka; and the ongoing Integrated Watershed Management Programme                                     (IWMP). Similarly, it was Prof. Rao’s untiring efforts that enabled the major communication                                     revolution in India by the use of the multi-purpose INSAT satellites substantially                                     contributing to long distance telecommunications, introduction of nationwide                                     TV and radio broadcast services and providing round the clock meteorological                                     observations and extensive use by closed user groups for educational, cultural as                                     well as business purposes; besides the weather forecasting and meteorological                                     services.                                     The bold decision taken by Prof.Rao in 80s to go in for the indigenously built                                     operational INSAT 2 series of satellites after the mixed success of the procured                                     INSAT 1 series of satellites, ensured a quantum jump in the satellite communication                                     applications                                     scenario, paving way for India to have a very large constellation of communication                                     satellites in the INSAT and GSAT series of today. Prof. Rao will be remembered not                                     only for the development of the space segment, but also a low cost ground segment                                     and applications                                     to meet the exploding requirements from the user community, and he did all these                                     with great professional aplomb. Some of the special steps taken by him during that                                     initial operational INSAT era have since then become large-scale operational                                     applications including                                     applications such as Telemedicine, Tele-education, Village Resource Centres (VRC)                                     and Disaster Management Support in the country reaching the common man with extended                                     outreach activities even to less accessible North-East, and other far flung areas                                     including islands.                                     INSAT and GSAT systems have enabled vast expansion of the applications like Direct                                     to Home (DTH), Satellite News Gathering (SNG), VSAT, internet services and extensive                                     use of space-based applications in e-Governance and developmental communications                                     applications. Besides these societal applications for national development, Prof.Rao’s                                     contribution to the space science missions is phenomenal. Starting with his direct                                     association in the early 60s in the international missions like MARINER-2,                                     PIONEER-7, 8, & 9; EXPLORER-34 & 41                                     making his own mark in his chosen area of solar winds, galactic cosmic rays; and                                     later with balloons, sounding rocket experiments, before venturing into our own                                     satellite missions like ARYABHATA, BHASKARA, and ROHINI series of satellites with                                     space science payloads especially                                     to study celestial X-ray and gamma ray bursts. As Chairman, of the Advisory                                     Committee on Space Sciences (ADCOS) for almost three decades, he led the country’s                                     efforts towards these research areas. Today, thanks to these initiatives of Prof.                                     Rao, the Indian Space Programme                                     encompasses research in areas like astronomy, astrophysics, planetary and earth                                     sciences, atmospheric sciences and theoretical physics. It was due to his untiring                                     efforts that ASTROSAT, India’s first dedicated multi-wavelength astronomy mission                                     came into being to study celestial                                     sources in X-ray, optical, and UV bands simultaneously. CHANDRAYAAN-1 and Mars                                     Orbier Mission (MOM) once again stand testimony to Prof. Rao’s commitment to space                                     science missions, providing both technological and scientific challenges, not only                                     to young engineers who built the                                     spacecraft in record time and mission personnel who ensured the successful complex                                     mission operations, but also the young scientists spread across the country who are                                     analysing the vast amount of data coming from these satellites. It is such a                                     combination of passion, forthrightness                                     and concern for scientific details and technological achievements that kept Prof.                                     Rao very active till the end in all the contemporary space missions of India, like                                     his continued involvement in India’s forthcoming missions like CHANDRAYAAN-2; Mars                                     Rover Mission and the ADITYA mission to                                     Sun as well as the recent discussions on Mission to Venus. Prof. Rao was                                     particularly very excited about the ADITYA mission and he ensured that it went                                     through a thorough revamp of its mission objectives including its orbital parameters                                     to make the mission more meaningful and contemporary.                                     Now, thanks to Prof. Rao, ADITYA will become the first mission from India to be                                     placed in the Lagrangian Point, L1, one of the liberation points in orbital                                     configuration,1.5 million kms from the Earth, where a satellite when placed will                                     have the same angular velocity as that of the earth with                                     respect to Sun and hence, maintain the same position in relation to sun as seen from                                     Earth. There were many scientific issues that were attracting Prof. Rao’s attention                                     like studying the sun’s Chromosphere, the transition region, the corona and its                                     heating problem. It is rather unfortunate that                                     he could not live to see the realisation of his pet mission. Prof. Rao is also credited with the setting up of ANTRIX Corporation in 1992, as a                                     wholly owned Government of India company under the administrative control of                                     Department of Space, to serve as a marketing arm of ISRO, for promotion and                                     commercial exploitation of space products and services, and                                     also to handle the transfer of technologies developed by ISRO to industries. For                                     example, it is through this unique arrangement that ISRO reaches its communication                                     transponders to various Indian users and its IRS satellite data services to many                                     countries in the world. ANTRIX today provides end-to-end solution,                                     ranging from supply of hardware and software systems, as well as, varied space                                     applications, and has an asset of around Rs.2000 crores. This model of ANTRIX set up                                     with a strong umbilical connection to ISRO, is considered to be a unique                                     contribution by Prof. Rao. Prof.Rao’s continued concern and the boldness with which he spear-headed his many                                     innovative ideas to operationalise the space technology applications of direct                                     societal relevance at the user-end made Indian Space Programme as one of the most                                     visible and the leading proponent of applications-driven space programmes                                     in the world, and many success stories from India were widely acclaimed in                                     international fora as worth emulating by other developing countries. Obviously, his                                     concern for the society transcended beyond the narrow confines of our county’s                                     boundaries and he took abundant interest in reaching out to the other developing                                     countries towards reaping the benefits of space technology for their own teeming                                     masses. As Vice President of International Astronautical Federation (IAF) and the                                     Chairman of the IAF Committee on Liaison with International Organisations and                                     Developing Nations (CLIODN) for more than one and half decades, he conducted along                                     with the United Nations, many Special Current Event Sessions during the Annual                                     Congress of IAF in different parts of the world on various aspects of space                                     applications with case studies and real life examples with concerned experts from                                     different developing countries sharing their experiences in using space technology                                     applications,                                     and the problems faced by them. It was once again his quest to build capacity in the developing countries in the                                     Asia and the Pacific to optimally integrate space technology applications in                                     development using the experience gained from India that brought the UN affiliated                                     Centre for Space Science Technology Education in the Asia Pacific (UN CSSTEAP) to                                     India against                                     intense competition and associated political pressures and negotiations in the Asia                                     Pacific Region. UN CSSTEAP in India has since then become the most vibrant centre in                                     the world, bringing laurels to India and Prof. Rao’s pioneering contribution to                                     bring this Centre to India will always be remembered by the country. With these and many other significant contributions to UN fora, Prof Rao had the                                     unique distinction of being the first one from outside the select group of countries                                     like USA, USSR and Europe to be elected as Chairman of the United Nations Committee                                     on Peaceful Uses of Outer Space (UN COPUOS), Vienna in 1997. Later, he was                                     unanimously                                     elected as the President of International UNISPACE III Conference, held in Vienna in                                     1999; an honour and prestige for Prof Rao, as well as for India, signifying India’s                                     rise as a global player in space technology applications. It is no wonder that Prof. Rao, for his life-long contribution to space science,                                     technology and applications had been bestowed with many national and international                                     awards and accolades; elected as fellow of many reputed academies and institutions;                                     awarded honorary doctorates by a number of universities; and his multi-faceted                                     skills and                                     services continue to be sought after, by many government and private bodies (See                                     Table-1 for details). For his lifelong exceptional and distinguished service to the                                     nation, the Government of India honoured him with the Padma Vibhushan in 2017. Thus, Prof Rao will be remembered for long as an inspirational leader par excellence                                     with forthright views, innovative ideas and speedy actions, which continue to instil                                     enormous confidence in young, aspiring space scientists and technologists in this                                     country with his driving mantra“if others can do, we can do better”. The illustrious life and legacy of Prof U.R.Rao – of a humble village boy from a                                     poor family from an obscure village near Udupi in Karnataka overcoming all the                                     challenges & obstacles and garnering glory in the frontier space science, technology                                     & applications, both nationally and internationally; and instrumental in building a                                     prestigious                                     institution of international standing like ISRO with its unique culture; and rising                                     to the position as its Chairman and attaining international fame; and working                                     tirelessly till his end in harnessing the benefits of space technology applications                                     for national development - should continue to be a motivational force and a role                                     model for many                                     young aspirants in our country and elsewhere for generations to come. May his soul rest in peace. Accomplishments of Prof. U.R. Rao Positions held Selected Honours and Accolades National"

Weighing 3477 kg at lift-off, GSAT-17 carries Payloads in Normal C-band, Extended C-band and S-band to provide various communication services. GSAT-17                                              also carries equipment for metereological data relay and satellite based search and rescue services being provided by earlier INSAT satellites. GSAT-17 is designed to provide continuity of services on operational satellites in C-band, Extended C-band and S-bands. GSAT-17 was launched into a Geosynchronous                                              Transfer Orbit (GTO) by Ariane-5 VA-238 launch vehicle. After its injection into GTO, ISRO's Master Control Facility (MCF) at Hassan takes control of GSAT-17 and                                              performs the initial orbit raising maneuvers using the Liquid Apogee Motor (LAM) of the satellite, placing it in circular Geostationary Orbit. The designed in-orbit operational life of GSAT-17 is about 15 years."

Several Indian and                                              international astronomy groups searched for corresponding electromagnetic signals in the sky. The Cadmium Zinc Telluride Imager                                              (CZTI) on AstroSat conducted the most sensitive search for short duration X-ray flashes associated with this event, but did not                                              find anything. The Hawaii-based ATLAS group found a transient optical source, which was thought to be related to GW170104. The CZTI team, in collaboration with the international GROWTH collaboration, studied this transient extensively, and proved that it                                              was not the counterpart of GW170104. Instead, it was a Gamma ray burst event caused by  the explosive death of a massive star in a galaxy                                              several billion light years away giving birth to a new black hole.

The                                     cryogenic stage designated as C25 was tested for a flight duration of 640 seconds at                                     ISRO Propulsion Complex (IPRC)                                     in Mahendragiri. C25 Stage had earlier been tested successfully for 50 seconds on                                     January 25, 2017 to validate all the systems. Prior to Stage development hot tests, three CE20 engines were realised and two                                     engines were subjected to qualification tests in sea level conditions. This included                                     800 seconds duration hot test and the third engine identified for flight was tested                                     in high Altitude conditions for a duration of 25 seconds. This Stage test is a significant milestone as it is the last in series of engine and                                     stage development hot tests before the first development flight of GSLV MkIII. The C25 stage is the most powerful upper stage developed by ISRO and uses Liquid                                     Oxygen (LOX) and Liquid Hydrogen (LH2) propellant combination. The stage carries                                     27.8 tons of propellants loaded in two independent tanks. Development of a cryogenic                                     stage has unique design challenges,                                     with liquid Hydrogen stored at -253 deg C and liquid Oxygen stored at -195 deg C in                                     its tanks. To store these cryogenic fluids, special multi-layer insulation is                                     provided for the tanks and other structures. The development of the cryogenic stage was led by Liquid Propulsion Systems Centre                                     (LPSC) with support from various System Development Agencies from other ISRO Centres                                     of ISRO, viz., Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre (VSSC), ISRO Propulsion Complex (IPRC)                                     and Sathish Dhawan Space Centre (SDSC), SHAR. The Cryogenic Stage development tests were carried out in two phases. First, the                                     Stage was subjected to fluid mock-up, wherein the stage preparation and servicing at                                     launch complex in SDSC, SHAR, Shriharikota was completed to prove all the ground                                     facilities established for servicing the cryogenic stage.                                     This was followed by testing of the Stage at ISRO Propulsion Complex, Mahendragiri.                                     From the Stage realisation to completion of testing was accomplished in four months. The performance of the Stage during the hot test was as predicted. Successful hot                                     test for flight duration qualifies the design of the stage and the robustness of the                                     facilities conceived and established towards its development. The flight cryogenic stage is in advanced stage of realisation, and forms the upper                                     stage of GSLV MkIII the next generation launch vehicle of ISRO, capable of launching                                     4 ton class satellites into Geosynchronous Transfer Orbit (GTO). The vehicle                                     consists of two solid strap-ons (S200) motors, one earth storable                                     liquid core stage (L110) and the Cryogenic Upper Stage (C25). The GSLV MkIII vehicle integration activities are in progress at SDSC, SHAR for its                                     first development flight (GSLV MkIII-D1) targeted for April 2017."

"event/ISRO_Successfully_Tests_C25_Cryogenic_Upper_Stage_of_GSLV_MkIII","has_description","ISRO Successfully Tests C25 Cryogenic Upper Stage of GSLV MkIIIHome/Archives/ISRO Successfully Tests C25 Cryogenic Upper Stage Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) successfully ground tested its indigenously developed Cryogenic Upper Stage for GSLV MkIII on January 25, 2017. The cryogenic stage designated as C25 was tested for a duration of 50 seconds at ISRO Propulsion Complex (IPRC) in Mahendragiri                                                      demonstrating all the stage operations. The performance of the Stage during the test was as predicted. This is the first test in a series of two tests.  The next test is planned for flight duration of 640 seconds. The 50 second test is a significant milestone in the development of indigenous cryogenic propulsion technology. The successful hot test of the stage in the first attempt itself demonstrates ISRO’s ability to work in new areas like cryogenic technology. The development of C25 cryogenic stage began with the approval of GSLV MKIII, the next generation launch vehicle of ISRO, capable of launching 4 ton class spacecraft in Geosynchronous Transfer Orbit (GTO). The vehicle consists of two solid strap-on motors (S200), one earth storable liquid core stage (L110)                                                      and the cryogenic stage upper stage (C25). The C25 stage was conceptualised, designed and realised by Liquid Propulsion Systems Centre (LPSC), ISRO’s lead Centre for Propulsion, with support from various System Development Agencies from other three Centres of ISRO – Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre (VSSC), ISRO Propulsion Complex (IPRC) and Sathish Dhawan                                                      Space Centre (SDSC) SHAR. The fabrication of various sub-systems of the engine and the stage was carried out through Indian Industries. The C25 stage is the most powerful upper stage developed by ISRO and uses Liquid Oxygen (LOX) and Liquid Hydrogen (LH2) propellant combination.  The stage carries 27.8 tons of propellants loaded in two independent tanks. Development of a cryogenic stage has unique design challenges, with liquid Hydrogen stored at -253 deg C and liquid Oxygen stored at -195 deg C in its tanks. To store these cryogenic fluids, special multi-layer insulation is provided for the tanks and other structures. The first flight stage for GSLV MkIII-D1 mission is in advanced stage of realisation. The flight engine has been successfully tested in the High Altitude Test (HAT) facility and integrated with the flight stage."

This is                                     a great loss for Indian Science and Technology. Though trained as a high energy physicist, Prof. Menon made rich contributions to                                     both scientific and technological domains of independent India as a prominent                                     science administrator. Prof. Menon was associated with Indian Space Programme right from its inception. He                                     was a member of Indian National Committee on Space Research (INCOSPAR), a national                                     body of eminent scientists chaired by Dr Vikram Sarabhai set up by the Government of                                     India in February 1962 to oversee the space programme of India. Prof. Menon was a                                     close associate of Dr. Vikram Sarabhai, the architect of Indian Space Programme and                                     was involved in many critical decisions taken during the Genesis and early                                     evolutionary years of Indian Space Programme. Following the sudden death of Dr. Sarabhai on December 30, 1971, the Indian                                     government asked Prof. Menon to head the Indian Space Programme. In spite of his                                     other significant responsibilities like the head of Electronics commission,                                     Director, Tata Institute of Fundamental Research and Director, PRL, Prof. Menon                                     accepted this formidable challenge and steered the Indian Space Programme during                                     January-September 1972. His decisions as chairman, ISRO facilitated the later rapid and orderly progress of                                     Indian Space Programme and its entry into the domain of satellites and Launch                                     Vehicles during 1970s. It was during the chairmanship of Prof. Menon the agreement between India and Soviet                                     Union on the launch of India's first satellite Aryabhata by a Soviet Rocket was                                     signed in May 1972. Prof. Menon also took the important decision to amalgamate                                     various entities involved in Space Research work at Thumba and Veli Hills into a                                     single large entity which later achieved fame as the Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre                                     (VSSC). Later, Prof Menon served as a member of space commission. Though the period during which Prof. Menon steered the Indian Space Programme was                                     brief, it was a momentous time and the decisions which he took during that period                                     had a profound influence on the expansion and sustenance of Indian Space Programme                                     resulting in India achieving the status of a key player in the domain of space."

Towards this, a one day meeting was organised at Inter-University Centre for Astronomy and Astrophysics (IUCAA), Pune on Thursday, Sept 29, 2016, to highlight the technical and scientific achievements of this Space Observatory. Chairman, ISRO dedicated the AstroSat Science Support Cell hosted at IUCAA (http://astrosat-ssc.iucaa.in/) and delivered the keynote address.  This was followed by an official release of AstroSat outreach resources such as posters. The first scientific results and the future scope of the satellite were presented followed by a panel discussion on the future of Indian Space Astronomy. The meeting was attended by several dignitaries from ISRO and other institutes from all over the country who have been involved with AstroSat. During this period of one year, the spacecraft has orbited the earth more than 5400 times and has executed 343 individual pointings to 141 different cosmic sources. The observed data are being routinely downloaded at the Indian Space Science Data Centre (ISSDC) at every visible pass and are being processed at the Payload Operation Centres. October 1, 2016 will mark the beginning of the Open Phase of the observatory. Available observing time over the subsequent six-month period (Cycle A02: October 2016-March 2017) was oversubscribed by a factor of six in observing proposals received from researchers of 59 different institutions. The rigorous process of selection of proposals and their scheduling has been completed and AstroSat is now ready to embark on the Open Phase observations. Click here to Download Pdf..(10.2 MB)"

Observing time will be awarded on the basis of peer-reviewed proposals. ISRO, in collaboration with the Inter-University Centre for Astronomy and Astrophysics (IUCAA), Pune has set up an AstroSat Support Cell (ASC) to facilitate the proposal making process and the use of AstroSat data. The Cell will operate out of IUCAA and will provide resource material, tools, training and help to guest observers. A website has been set up (http://astrosat-ssc.iucaa.in) containing a portal to the AstroSat Proposal Processing System (APPS), Exposure Time and Visibility calculators. The site also provides downloadable proposal assistance tools, instrument response functions, sample data of AstroSat instruments and analysis software. Activities of the AstroSat Support Cell will include providing long-term support and maintenance of the APPS, running a help desk for proposal and data related queries, and organising workshops to familiarize users with proposal preparation and data analysis techniques. It is planned to hold every year two long duration workshops at IUCAA and several short duration workshops at different parts of the country. A Memorandum of Understanding between ISRO and IUCAA for the operation of the AstroSat Support Cell has been signed on May 05, 2016."

"event/Asia_Pacific_Remote_Sensing_Symposium_held_at_New_Delhi","has_description","Asia Pacific Remote Sensing Symposium held at New DelhiHome/Archives/ Remote Sensing Symposium Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), along with theMinistry of Earth Sciences (MoES)and theSPIE(the International Society for Optics and Photonics) organised the 10thedition of Asia Pacific Remote Sensing Symposium, 2016 (APRS 2016) during April 4-7, 2016 at New Delhi. TheIndian Society of Remote Sensing (ISRS), which is a professional society of more than 4000 scientists/researchers, hosted this Symposium. Many Heads of Space Agency namely Mr Charles F. Bolden, Administrator ofNational Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA); Mr Jean-Yves Le Gall, President ofFrench National Space Agency (CNES); Mr Shizuo Yamamoto, Vice President,Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA); Mr Yan Hua Wu, Vice Administrator ofChina National Space Administration (CNSA); Dr Alan Ratier, Director General of European Organisation for Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites                                                      (EUMETSAT); Mr Francisco Javier Mendieta,Mexican Space Agency (AEM)and Mr Kiran Kumar, Chairman, ISRO gave their vision on next steps in space observations and international collaboration during the Special Plenary session. This prestigious symposium was attended by 300 National participants and 130 International participants across 15 countries. APRS Symposium focussed on applications of remote sensing technologies for disaster mitigation and to better monitor global climate change. The prime motive of the symposium is to garner new initiatives and collaborative international efforts towards space based observations for weather and climate. The deliberations during the symposium were aimed at enabling better coordination amongst space agencies to explore the means of harnessing the benefits of space technology for the betterment of humanity. The symposium was preceded by two-day pre-symposium tutorials on 'Trends and Challenges in Remote Sensing & Geo-informatics', 'Satellite Meteorology and Data Assimilation', 'Remote Sensing Optical Sensor Calibration and Characterisation' and 'Designing the Climate Observing System of the future' during April 2-3, 2016, organised by Indian Institute of Remote Sensing, Minister of Earth Sciences, NASA Goddard Space Flight Centre and NASA Langley Research Centre. The first day of the symposium had a Special Plenary session on 'Next Steps in Space Observations - Vision for International Collaboration' with Chiefs of Many Space Agencies as distinguished speakers followed by a Panel discussion on 'Space, Earth and Humanity'. Another Plenary session on 'Roadmap to Space based Earth Observations & Applications' held in the afternoon with distinguished speakers from India and abroad. They discussed the possibility of studying effects of climate change with the help of space technologies. The seven parallel conferences of the symposium included 80 technical sessions and 10 poster sessions. The symposium deliberated on more than 800 papers in the area of remote sensing for atmosphere, clouds and precipitation, land surface and cryosphere, oceans and inland waters, Lidar for environmental monitoring, hyperspectral and ultraspectral technology, techniques and applications, earth observing missions and sensors, modeling of the atmosphere, oceans and interactions, etc. The participants presented their scientific work related to various aspects of remote sensing, the latest developments and applications, cutting-edge technologies, research ideas and international collaboration. The International Exhibition showcasing the spectrum of activities of space agencies and space industries was inaugurated by Dr Jitendra Singh, MOS, PMO. Thereafter, Minister had an interaction with all Space Agency Chiefs. As an associated event, ISRO and CNES organised a reception on April 3, 2016 (Sunday), during which Space Agency heads presented their views on the topic “Space and Climate: How will space agencies contribute to implementing and following up the COP-21 agreement"".Agency Chiefs and their representatives from AEM, CNES, CNSA, CTRS (Morocco’s Royal Centre for Remote Sensing), EUMETSAT, ESA (European Space Agency), ISRO, JAXA and NASA attended this event. They confirmed their commitment to use space technology tools and applications for climate change studies and to monitor COP-21 results. The agency heads approved the principles of a declaration underlining the commitments made by the space sector at the COP-21 in Paris. This Declaration calls for evolving space-based operational tools combining in-situ measurements and increased computing resources. To this end, space agencies will need to develop new technologies to be flown in space or encourage their research community to contribute actively with new models. Success will depend on the cooperation to cross-calibrate instruments and cross-validate their measurements, in order to achieve an international, independent system for estimating the emissions of all world nations based on internationally accepted data, thus creating a level playing field and an independent basis for further reductions. Through this Declaration, the world’s space agencies are also committing to establish a global framework to move forward on these matters. This Declaration once endorsed by Committee on Earth Observation System (CEOS) in April 2016 will pave way for comprehensive global climate data system to support current and future generations of spacecraft."
